XXIV-Fran. Sed. 880-891. Ob. April 24.

Son of Maelduin, of the tace of Conall Gulban. His pedigree is given in the Naemhseanohas,
but it is evidently deficient in some generations, for it makes him twelfth in descent from Conau
Gulban, while Adamnan, who died nearly two centuries before, was eighth. Colgan latinizes
his name by Florentius, and states his festival to be April 24 (Tr. Th. p. 481 a, n. 24).

xxv-Mammam. Coarb 891-927. Ob. Febr. 22.

Son ofTornam of the tace of Conall Gulban, from whom, according to the pedigree preserved
in the Naemhseanchas, he was thirteenth iu descent. He is commemorated in the Calendars of
Marian and of Denegal at Feb. 2 ε, at which day the latter authority states that the mother of Mael-
brighde was Saerlath‚ daughter ofCuilebadh, son of Baethghaile. This is copied from the Tract De
Manibus Sanctorum Hiberniae, commonly attributed to AEngus the Culdee. ,But the date of that
writer is circ. 800, whereas this, his alleged composition, refers to amau who died in 927. Mael-
brighde was not only abbot of Hy, but of Armagh and Raphoe, and his celebrity must have been
considerable to elicit the following eulogium from the Four Masters: ⁴⁴ St. Maclbrighde, son of
Tornan, coarb of Patrick, Columcille, and Adamnan, head of the piety of all Ireland and of the
greater part of Europe, died ina good old age, on the zznd of February.⁷’ He had been elected
abbot of Armagh on the death of Maeleobha. in 888. His penultimate predecessor held the
abbacy of Hy with that of Kildare: this abbot holds it with that of Annagh and Raphoeq au
additional evidence of the declension of Hy. See Colgan's Acta SS. p. 386.
