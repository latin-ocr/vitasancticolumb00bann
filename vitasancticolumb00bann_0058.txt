xxxiv Prqface.

VII. The latest and much the most copious collection of the Saint's acts
is that by Manus O'Dounell, chief of Tit-Connell, which professes to be, and
is, a chronological digest os all the existing recor-ds concerning the patron of
his family. His framework consists of Adamnan and the old Irish Life3 into
this he has worked :—-1. The historica] allusions found in the volume ospoemsk
ascribed to St.Columba; 2, The substance of the preface to the Amhra
Choluim-cille ; 3, Extracts from the prefaces to the Latin hymns ascribed to
St. Columba, and from the hymns themselves, as preserved in the Liber Hym-
norum3 4, Some notes from the comments on the Feilire of Aengus¹3 5, The
matter in the poems on Cormae Ua Liatha‘mm3 6, Passages from the lives of
contemporary saints, especially St. Mochonna, 01· Maehar, of Aberdeen¹¹3
7, The alleged prophecies of Berchan of Clonsast03 8, Some legendary
poemsp on the wanderings of certain Coltunbian monks, which far outdo St.
Brendan's Navigation in wilduess of incident. O’Donnell’s statement‘l is ε “Be
it known to the readers of the Life, that it was buried in oblivion for a long
time, aud that there was not to be found, but a fragment of the book which
holy Adamnan compiled of it in Latin, and another small portiom· in Irish,
compiled by the Irish poets in a very diffleult dialect3 and theremainder in
legends scattered throughout the old books ofErin.⁷’ These matcrials, with
one or two trifling eweptions, all exist at the present day, and have more or
less been consulted for the present work. It would be quite possible for a
good scholar and patient investigator, endowed with an inventive wit, and a
copious style, to compile fi·om materiale existing in the year of Grace 18 36, a
narrative to the full as circumstantia-l, as diffuse, and as marvellous, as that

¹ Smallportiou.-—It appears from the eontents
ofO'Donnell's work that he had a perfect copy
of Adamnan and the entire os the old Irish Life,
but he calls the one a blot) bon lehun, ‘ frag-
ment οἱ the book: and the other becun eh, ‘ a
trifle more‚' because they fell so far short of
his own great conceptions. See the description
