Fmv nameS, in passing firom their real to their phonetic forms, have undergone such
transfonnations as that of 0111· 01111101. Who would suppose that Adamnan and Eunan
were intended for the same person, 01· that Adampnanus and T heuman were resolvable
into a common original? Adamnan is an Irish diminutive of Adam, as Cormac inter-
prets the word in 1115 Glossary : GOOYUNGN ,1. 11011111115011111Γ, olpbecor') (11111ιο
(leonii, ‘ ADOMNAN, i. e. homunyeulus, a diminutive of the name Adam! Under the
effect of aspiration, clocam loses the force of its consonants, and assumes the various
sounds of Au, Ea, O, and 02⁴5 hence, when the diminutive termination is added, it
produces the respective words Amana, Eunanb, Onam, Ozman: these are the forms of
pronunciation which the name Adamnan has assumed in Ireland.

In the north-east of Seotland, as in Aberdeen and Banff, there is a tendeney 10
11101111 certain consonants to saints’ names, either asan equivalent for δά, 01· 10 facilitate
the pronunciation. Thus St. Rule becomes Trowel, and St. Antony Tantam& and hence
Eunan becomes Thoumna, as in the parish of Aboyne²‚ where a fresh change takes place,
and St. Adamnan’s Well and Trec become Skeulan Wall, and Skeulan Tree. Again, at
F orvey‚ in the parish of Slainss, Adamnan becomes Fc'danmam and in Forgleng, Adam-
nan's church is fimum Kwk. But, at Duff, in Athon, the form Eonan is preserved,
as at Kileherran in Cantyre, where we find the compound B'z'lleecnane or Killownanei. ·

The consequence of 11115 ‹h‘versity 1111110 written and spoken forms of the name has
been that even the best writers have created one or more additional saints, and have
put the acts of Adamnan in commission. Thus, in Ireland, Sir J ames Ware represents
Raphoe as founded by Columba, repaired by Adamnan‚ and changed from an abbey 10
a cathedral by St. Eunan, “who is looked upon 10 be the first Bishop of the see''¹⁵.
