srnall semicircular platform‚ formed by an cx-
pansion of the hill. On the north-east is awell,
and on the south-east is the entrance to the fort,
5 feet wide, ascending abruptly by rude steps.
On the north-east was also a long gassei-y,
formed against the side of the apex by large
stones regularly laid, with an inclination in-
wax-ds, and covered with cross flags‚ similar to
the cyclopcan structure of the Grianan Ailech
(Ord. Mem. Templemore‚ pp. 217-221)‚ 40 feet
long, by 2 broad, serving as a covered way, and
also as breast-work on the accessible side. The
whole erest ot'the hill was enclosed by a cyclo-
pean wall, ot' which some traces remain, though
the mass ot' it has been precipitated down the
sides, and either carried away for buildiug pur-
poses elsewhere, or suffered to lie in debris at
the foot. The remarkable gallery which has
been just mentioned was disturbed and reduced
to its present condition, which is little better
than a great ridge of dry stoneS, by a person
who, about thirty years ago, brought a number
of men to the spot ‘⁴ to search the cove for
money‚’' and, with them, a barrel of beer to
stimulate their exertions. In the Ord. Sui-vey
the hill is placed in the townland Sronce, which
is a modern denomination. (Sheet 7, east
eilge.) Properly, three townlands meet at the
spot, now called Lenagarron, Belgarra‚ and
Knoeknamult, and comprehendet} in Lennagor-
ran and Knoekmult, in the Londonderry Char-
ter. (Concise View of the Irish Soc. Append.‚

Hy Neill there existed a hostile feeling from the
time of the battle of Moin-doire, mentioned at
cap. 7. Aedh Dubh, lord of the former⁷ in
565, slew Diarmait (see cap. 36). In the year
preceding the present engagement, Congal
Caech, or Claen, King of Uladh, slew Suibhne
Meann, mouarch of Ireland, who was of the
Cenel Eoghain branch of the northern Hy Neill,
and thus made room for the accession of Domh-
nall‚ as predicted in chap. 10, supra, who
avenged his kinsman‘s death in the manner re-
lated in the text. For Congal Claen's move-
ments aster this battle, see the note on Bellum
Roth, iii. 5, infra.

that he was in his fifth year at the date of the
battle. He speaks in the first person also in
i. z, iii. 19, 23.

¹¹¹ Finanus.—Of the nine saints of this name
in the calendar⁷ Colgan supposes him to be the
Finan Lobhar ofMar. 16. (Act. SS. p. 627.)
O'Donnell, upon what authority is uncertain, ν
says of him: ‘¹ S. Finnen qui iu monasterio de
Illayli-Cosynin anachoreticam vitam diu trans-
duxit.’·—i. 95. (Tr. Th. 404 b.) That place
is now called Macosquin. See note on Canibus.

⁰ Ca111bas.-This monastery was founded by
S. Comgall, probably under the pati-onage os
the Pictish residents in Dun—da-bheann or
Mountsandal, and Dun-Ceithern‚ whose oc-
cupatiori of this territory is still attested by
the townland ofDrumcroon, or ⁴ Picts Ridge‚’ in
the same parisb, and Duncroon, or ¹ Picts Fort,'
in the adjacent pat-ish of Magilligan. In the
