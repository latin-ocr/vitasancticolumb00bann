The word is not found in Bede's Hist. Eccl.;
it occurs one-e in his Hist. Abb. Uuirem., where
the abbot of Jarrow describes himself as an
ecclesiastical office bearet in Saenia—c. ¹4
(p. 329, ed. Hussey). The Four Masters use
Saxa, and its inflexions, sor Saxones.

¹Aldfridum.—Oswy, King of Northumbria,
died in 670, and was succeeded by his son Eg-
frid⁴ Aldfrid, though an elder brother, was
superseded on the ground of illegitimacy.
Whereupon, it is related, ¹¹ in Hiberniam, seu
vi seu indignatione, secesserat. Ibi, et ab
odio germani tutum et magno otio literis im-
butus, omni philosophia composuerat animum.
Quocirca, imperii habenis, habiliorem aestiman-
tes, qui quondam expulerant ultro expetive-
runt.''—Wilhelmi Malmesbir.‚ Gest. Reg. 52
(ed. Thomas D. Hardy, 1 840). Bede states that
when Elfleda applied to St. Cuthbert for infor-
mation about her brother ngrid's successor on
the throne, his answer was: “Cernis hoc mare
magnum et spatiosum, quot abundet insulis?
Facile est Deo de aliqua barum sibi providere
quem regno praeficiat Anglorum. Intellexitergo
quia de Aldfrido, qui ferebatur filius fuisse pa-
tris illins, et tunc in insulis Scotorum ob stu-
dium litterarum exulabat.‘’ And adds, “ngri-
dus post annum Pictorum gladio trucidatur, et
Alfridus in regnum frater ejus nothus substi-
tuitur, qui non paucis ante temporibus in re-
gionibus Scotorum lectioni operam dabat, ibi
ob amorem sapientiae, spontaneum passus exi-
lium-”—Vit. S. Cuthberti, c. 24 (Colg. Aet. SS.
p. 668.) So in the Legenda Aurea (lb. p. 683 α).
Thus three reasons are assigned for his retire-
ment to Ireland. Irish writers add two more:
they state that his mother was anative of that

country, and observe: ‘⁴ Non sui tantum literis
excolendi eausain Hiberniam venit, verum etiam
ut sanctis Hiberniae deprecantibus limace qui
in aurem ejus irrepsit, et capitis humoribus at-
tractis intumuit edueto, molestia, et morbo ex
ea re contracta immum's efficeretur.” (Lynch,
Cambr. Evers. p. 128 ; or vol. ii. p. 236, reprint.)
His descent by his mother's side is stated by
AEngus, a writer of the eighth century, to have
been from the princely house of Niall: pinu

¹ Fina, daughter of Cennfaeladm was mother of
Flann Fina, son of Ossa. Aliter, Fina, daugh-
ter of Colman Rimidh, son of Baedan, son of
Muircertach, son of Muiredhach. was mother
of Flann Fina, king of the Saxons.' (Tract.
de Matr. SS. Hib., Liber Lecan.‚ fol. 433 H.
2. 16, Trin. Coll. Dubl. p. 365.) In the Clann
Neill genealogy (Lib. Lecan. fol. 63), Fina is
represented as great-grauddaughter ofMuir-
certach, either through his son Eaedem, or
Ailill, father of Cennfaeladh. Under the name
Flam: Firuz Aldfrid was familiarly known by
the Irish. Thus at A. C. 704. Tighernach re-
cording his death says: Gippich moe Opru
