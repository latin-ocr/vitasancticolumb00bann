—Cap. 31. (eod. Marsh. sol.147 ba; Tr. Th.
p. 457 b.) lt is certain that S. Columba was es-
tablished in Hy when the “magna domus'‘ of
Durrow was a-building. See i. 29, iii. 15, inf.

Γ Cerani coenobio.--Clonmaen0i=.e was founded
in 548 by Cim-an mec on c-room ⁴ Filius Ar-
tificis.' King Diarmait (i. 14, 36 inf), his chief
patron. granted the site and endowments. The
saint died on the 5th of Sept., 549, in the 34th
year of his age. He was esteemed one of the
rhief saints of Ireland, and his monastery rose
to the highest importanee. Cummiau's Paschal
epistle calls him Queranus coloniensis, and
ranks him among the ¹⁴ Patres priores” of the
Irish. (Ussher, Syll. xi.) The old adjectives
t'lonoensis and coloniensis are formed from
Cluavn, the first component in the name CLumn
mie Now, ⁴ Meadow of son of Nos‚' which was
derived from Nos son of Fiadach. one of the
Dealbhna-Eathra, the tribe in whose district,
now known as the barony of Garryeastle in
King's Couuty, the abbey was situate. Later
lrish writers added even another element to
the name (as Four Mast. 1461); but legal re-
vertis are generally content with the form
cluanensis. or Clonensie: hence, as the See os
Clnyne‚ which in Irish is cincun-nmium, is

also latinized by elenensis. it is sometimes diffi-
cult to distinguish between it and Clonmac-
muse, which was also a bishop's See.

‘¹ Ayellulis vicinis.-Agi·ieulture was probably
a leading occupation under St. Claran's‚ as well
as St. Columba’s rule, attracting to the neigh-
bourhood the externa] dependents who are al-
luded to in the text. Ι

f Vallum monasteria—The rampart which is
described by Bede as enelosing St. Cuthbert's
little monastery in Farne may be taken as the
type ol'the Irish monastic vallum. (H. Ε, iv.
28; inore fully in Vita S. Cuthberti, cap. ¹7-)
