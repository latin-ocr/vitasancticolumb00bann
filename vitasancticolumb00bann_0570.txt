137, line 1, on Cronani filiiBaithani, noia, This Cronan was probably son of the Baotan who appears in the
genealogy of the Scottish Dalriatls as son of Fergus Salach, son of Loaru-Mor, or else Baodnu, son
of Eochaidh, son of Muiredhach, son os Loam Mor, from one of whom Kinolbadon, or anelbathyn,
a sub-territory in Lorne, now represented by Morvern, derived its name. See pp. 180, 292. The
encounter which is mentioned in the text was probably the result of a descent made by Lam-dees,
who was of the house of Gahhran, ou the territory of the house of Lorne. The insula Ζωϊρα where
it took place may have been Lismore, which lies off Mor-vem on the S. E., aud geographically an-
swers to the name Lonffa, being ten miles long, and averaging only a mile and a half iu breadth.

burg HeadS, a name which suggests Carnburg as probably an earlier form than Cairnbulg. See
Histoi-{eal Collections of Abenleen and Banff (Spalding Club), vol. ἰ. p. 452. There is also a
Carnburgh among the Treshnish Islauds off Mun, on the north of Hy; but this point is not so geo-
graphically suitable as the former, which is situate at the extremity of the longest north-eastern
diameter that can be drawn from Clew Bay.
