Surnarned Mae Ronain. In the seventh char-ter of Kells is the name os a coarb of Colum-
cille, which is partly illegible, but the portion which is distinct, namely, Maelbriy . . . nan,
seems referable to this abbot (Miscell. Ir. Ascli. Soc. p. 148). Whether owing to the decline
of Kells, or the growing influence of Derry, or what is more probable, the commencement os
diocesim episcopacy in Ireland, the title of Coarb ⁰f Columcille is intermitted in the Annals nt
this period, and is afterwards resumed‚ more as an honorary than 3 real dignity. It is con-
tinued, indeed, in the Charters of Kells, to the abbots ofthat church, but when next it appears
in the Annass, it is transferred to Derry, which church seems to have derived an impulse at this
period from its connexion with Armagh (see An. 1 1 22, 1 137)⁷ but more especially from the
circumstance that the southern Hy Neill of Meam, under whose patronage, during the long·
continued period that they were supreme, the chief monastery of their territory proportionately
flourished‚ had now declined in power, and the Cine] Eoghain⁷ the chief branch of the northern
Hy Nem, now represented by the Mac Lochlainus, and afterwards by the O'Neills, were rising
into power, whose various elanus, scattered over Tyrone, exercised their influence in Armagli,
while their kinsmen of Inis-Eoghain, having Derry in their territory, in a great measure con-
trolled its appointments also.
