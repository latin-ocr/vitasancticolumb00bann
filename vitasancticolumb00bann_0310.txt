206 Vita Sancti Columba> [Lm. 111.

ex fratribus iisdem volebant jugulare sudibusb. Ipse vero contra tales aemulos
unus homo innumeros, accepta Pauli armatura⁰ apostoli, forti conflictu dimica-

¹⁸ Sudibus.—This may be taken metaphori-
cally, for, on the expulsion of the demous to
the Ethica terra, their assaults were felt in the
form of pestilent diseases. Thus the word
arrow is used in Psal. xci. 5 ; and ’ἰος in Iliad,
A. 48. At sea their violence was experienced
in the raging of tempests. See ii. 34 (p. 149)
supra, cap. iii. ¹3 (p. 214) infra.

Ρ Pauli armatura.—Ephes. vi. 13-17· It was
thus, as Bede relates‚ that St. Cuthbert freed
the little island of Farne from demoniaca] oc-
cupation. vit. S. Cuthb. c. 17³ Hist. Eecl. iv. 23.

d Echicam terram—The island of Tiree. See
note b, i. 19 (p. 48) supra. To which may be
added, in reference to the transition forms of
the name, that Martin calls it Tire-ijs, but
partly errs in deriving it from Tire, a country,
and iy, an isthmus. (West. Islands, p. 267.)

ε Effuyati sunt. -- Cruachan-aichle, now
Croagh Patriok, a mountain in Mayo, is fa-
mous in legendary record as the scene of St.
Patrick's final conflict with the demons of Ire-
land: from its summit he drove them into the

ocean, and completed their discomfiture by
flinging his bell, the Bearnan Briyhde, among
their retreating ranks. (Vit. Trip. ii. 64, Tr.
Th. p. 138 α.) passing northwards‚ they
emerged from the deep, and took up their
abode in the savage wilds of Seangleann, on
the south-west of Donegal. Here they re-
mained unmolested till our Tirconnellian saint
was directed by an angel to rid the place of
its foul inhabitants. After a violent struggle
with the demons, he completely routed them,
and with the help of the Dubh-duaibseuch, his
bell, drove them once for all into the sea.. His
name was henceforward associated with the
tract, and the wild parish of Glencolumbkill
presel-ves in its topography and traditions a
living eommentary on the legend of St. Co-
lumba's first visit to it, as told by Manus O'Don-
nell in 1520. (Vit. S. Columbae, i. 89, Tr. Th.
p. 403 b.) Sliabh Liag, commonly called Slieve-
League, a precipitous mountain in this region,
commands, in clear weather, a view os Croagh
Patrick cn the south-west.
