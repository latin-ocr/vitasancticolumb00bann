ssIemoz‘r of St. Adanman. liii

the 50111 of Adamnan desired to remain in the happy region, but that “it heard from
behind him, through the veil, the voice of his guardian angel commanding it to be
replaced in the same body from which it had passed ; and that it should relate in the
assemblies and conventions of the laity and 010135Υ the rewards of heaven and the 1101115
of 11011, 511011 as the eondueting angel had revealed to him. It was therefore the pre-
cept which Adamnan preaehed whilst he was alive. It was 11115 precept, too, which
was preaehed in the great convention of the men of Erin, When Adamnan’s Rule was
put on the Gaedhil; and when women were made free by Adamnan and Finaehta
Fledaeh‘, son of Dunohadh, 5011 of Aedh Slaine, 1110 King of Erin, and by the men of
Erin also. For it was alike that men and women went into battles and 11110 0011111015,
until the the Rule of Adamnan was imposed.’' A second vision, or rather a supple-
1110111, reeounting the wiekednesses of 1110 inhabitants os 1re1and, and 1110 11101111111105
with which they were m'sitcd, and should be visited, follows, and mentions such
ehastisements as 1110 Seamhaclz, or ‘ Leprosy3⁷ 1110 Bo-ar¹ or ¹ Cow mortality3 1110 Dz'ybaz'l
toraz'd, or ‘Blight of fruit;' 1110 Gorta, or ‘Famine ;’ the Isza, 01· ‘Searoity ;' and
Dzme'baclh, or ‘ Human 11101·1111115’;1 against 011 of which it declares prayer and fasting to
be 1110 only sure preservative.

From 697 till the year of 1115 (100111, Adamnan seems to have remained iu Ireland :
for, though the soeial improvement which 110 effeeted is despatched in a few words 111
1110 Α1111015, we ean hardly conceive that 50 vital a 1110051110 was brought about without
much exertion and preparatory solicitation. The 51100055 ofhis paschal advoeaey among
a people naturally attached 10 old prej udices⁷ in eommunities widely spread, and sub-
ject to many antagonistic inssuenees, must have required a longer period for its eom-
pletion than the following words of Bedcu would at first sight 500111 10 imply: ‘¹ N avi-
gaxit Hiberniam, 01 praedicaus 015, ae modesta exhortatione declarans legitimum
pasehae tempus, plurimos eorum, 01 110110 01111105 qui ab Hiiensinm dominio erant
liberi, ab errore avito correctos ad unitatem reduxit catholicam, et legitimum paseha}
tempus observare perde(·uit.” Τ110 Life of St. Gerald of Mayo, a compilation full of
anachronisms, has yet this eurious coincidence with the statement just made, that it
allows Adamnan a seren years' residence in Ireland. N ow, admitting the snpposition
above stated to be eorreet, 1110. interval between 697 and 704, the year of Adamnan's
death 15 exaetly commensurate with this period. One thing appears certain from
Bede, namely, that Adamuau 01055οᾶ over from Ireland to Hy in the summer of the
year in which he died, and that he had been in Ireland for a considerable 111110 pre-
viously. The Irish Annals record an occurrence which almost proves him 10 have
been in Ireland in 701. In that year Irgalaeh, son of Conang, great-grandson οἴ
