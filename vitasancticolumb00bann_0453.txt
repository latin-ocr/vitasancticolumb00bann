were provided: the priest (77) standing before the altar (222) proceeded to consecrate,
sacra Eucharistz’oe consecrare mysteria (221), sacram oblationem consecrare (222), sacra
Eucharistiae mysteria conficere (77), Christi corpus conficere (85). When several priests
were present, one was selected for the office (77, 220), who might invite a presbyter
ut sionul Domz'm'cum panem franqerent in tokcn of equality (85). When a bishop offi-
ciated at the altar, he brake the bread alone, in token of his superior office (86). The
brethren then approached the altar, and partook of the Eucharist (158).

On extraordinary occasions the abbot summoned the brethren by tho sound of the
bell to the oratory (33, 170, 213), even in the dead of night (51), on which occasions
he addressed them as they stood in their places (170), and having asked their prayers
(ila), he lmeeled down himself at the altar (170), and sometimes praycd with tears
(171). Sometimes the abbot (123, 163, 224), or a brother (223, 225), rosc from hjs
bed even in a winter night (219, 22 3), and proceeded alone to the oratory for private
devotion⁰ (ὦ), and if the door was closed, prayed outside (225). Oecasionally the
founder retired in the daytirnc to a thicket to pray (138), {md even in Hy, it was his
practice to reth-0 in winter nights to lonely places for prayer (205, 219). In all these
cases the secular abode was avoided3 but in cases of sickness the abbot was wont to pray
beside the patient's bed, in a standing (144, 203) or kneeling (146) posture.

The chief Festiml was the paschalis solemnitas (158, 228), on which occasion the
Eucharist was celebrated (158), and the scason was specially regarded as Zaete'tz‘oe sesti-
ritas (229). The period which elapscd between Easter-day and WVhitsunday
was called Paschales dies (117), and it was the term of the greatest indul· Festa.
genoep during the year. For a considerable time after the rectification of the
Pascha] rule in the Chureh of Rome, the Columbian society tenaciously adhercd to the
observance of their founder, whereby there was sometimes as much as a month's inter-
valq between their Easter and that of other ehurches3 and it was not until A.D. 716
that they acquiesced in the general practice (28). The Natalftzwn Domini (117) was
another sacred festival, for which some made preparation¹ during the forty days imme-
diately preceding.

⁰ Private devotiora—St. Benedict enjoins the im-
mediate departure of the congregation from the ora-
tory when the office is finished, that any brother
desimus to engage in private prayer may be undis·
turben—Cap. 52.

Ρ Indulyence.-It was to save his brethren from
the interruption of this enjoyment that St, Columba
wished his life to be spared till Pentecost (229).
Bede tei-ms this season the remissio quinquagesimae
paschalis (H. E. ἰῑῐ. 5).

Segienus, abbot of Hy, speaking of his abode in
Rome, says: “In uno hospitio curn Graeco et Ile-
