Late in the history of the Columbian order comes under notice the society called

Ouldees¹.

They had no particular connexion with this order any more
than had the Deoradhs or the other developments of conventual observance.

it was lost when Naiton. king of the Picts, expelled the Columbian elergy firom his

jurisdiction became defined and established (297). Even among the soom, the pres-

¹ Caldam—The earliest mention of the order is
in the Anuals of Ulster, at 920, where is recorded
a plundering of Armagh by Godsrey the Daue,
who, however, spared the orator-ies, with their Ceile-
De. The Four 111351Ἷ indeed, at 806, tell of the
CeiIe-De, who wrought great wonders; but the pas-
sage, having no parallel support, seems apocryphal.
The limits of a note will not admit the discussion of

so intricate and varied an inquiry as the history of
the Culdees, but the writer hopes to have an early
opportunity of dealing with the subject in a special
dissertation. In the meantime it is sufficient to say
that Culdee is the most abused term in Scotic church
history.
