‘Ross Fiuuehuill was its first name, and Esgar
Braunain is its name now, from Brannan the
poet. And he spoke tho poem:

Ross Finnchuill of Cluain Diothrach,
where youths and greyhounds used to be,
Was a dark wood. royal its gifts,
For the hunting of Dathi Mic Fiachrach.

Beibh'mn. the daughter of powerful Briau,
Was the mother of Dathi mac Fiachraeh
It was she. as 1 have heard here,
Who obtained the Meadows round the fair Βοὲς.

The Esgir of Brunnem, sou of Eochnjdh.
The grave of Coun of the hundred hattles,
Was a dark usk-forest until now,
For the chflse οἱ Finncuin os Clm-Diothraigu·

Α church, called Lanu Maeldubh from Fintan
Maeldubh, is described as situate between
Ross-na-righ and the Boyne (Book of Lein-
ster). Or, as in the Naemhsenchas, Fintan,

and Maeldubh of Leitir-Maelduibh at Ros-na-
rig. (Lib. Lecau.) And the Life of St. Finnian
states that previously to his fixing his seat at
Clonard he founded a. ehurch at Esear-Branain,
which (and not Clonard, as Colgan sayS, Act.
SS. p. 398 b, n. 23) was ancieutly called Ros-
machont—cap. 16 (Act. SS. p. 39411).

b Christi miles.—This expression is fre-
quently used by Adamnan in reference to the
monastic profession. We find antaee, from
mec, miles, as an ecclesiasti'cal term in An.
Ult. 11 10. The same word occurs in the argu-
ment of the Feilire, which Colgan paraphrases
“qui ex saeculi milite miles Christi sactus.''
(Act. SS. p. 579 b.) The expression moine
empc of Tigh. 729, is Christi miles in An. Ult.
728. See Tigh. 738.

ἒ Luyudius filius Tailclzani.—The Calendars
commemorate Lugaio paccano, ‘ Lughaidh
the presbyter‚' at Mar. 2, whom Colgan iden-
tifies with the above, and devotos a chapter
to, at the same (lay (Act. SS. p. 452), but ad-
duces no fresh information. A Tailchanus is
mentioned in i. z (p. 23) supra, but he cannot
be the same as the present Tailehanus, for the
son of the former was juvenis subsequently to
the time that the son of the latter was a senez.
This is one of the few cases where the Calend-
ars fail to assist us.

d Fer9n0u0.-Called Virynous further on.
We find the Irish name Ρθῃδηο similarly
latinized in cap. 19 (p. ²25) supra. Colgan sup-
poses that this was the Feargna, afterwards
