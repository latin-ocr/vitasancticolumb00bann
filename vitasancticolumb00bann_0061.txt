scripts, which bore on the history of St. Columba or his order; and from this
valuable store he has drawn as freely as the limits ot the work would
allow him.

⁷ In the department of topography the editor has been able to pronounee
with certainty upon many points which have hitherto been undeterniined.
With two exceptione, every Irish name in Adamnan has been identified 3 and
many Scotch names, which hitherto were matter of conjecture, have been
traced to their true positions. Two journeys to the WVestern Isles afforded
to the editor advantages, not only of personal examination, but of an introduc—
tion to those whose local knowledge was a living reference in cases ofdifficulty.
It was thus that he has been enabled, in the case of Iona, to add to his own
passing ohservation the constant experience of the Rev. Donald Mac Vean, one
of the ministers of that island, who has been at all times ready, in the most
obliging manner, to satisfy inquiry, and to whom the topographical account
of Hy in the present volume owes much of its accuracy and detail.

From Joseph Robertson, Esq., of the Genera] Register Housc, Edinburgh‚
the editor has received many valuable references and suggestions. To William
Skene, and John Stuart, Esqrs„ he is also under similar obligations.

That noble work, the Oriyz'nes Paraclziales Scotiaed, formed a most valna-
ble precursor to the present undertaking, as the numerous references to it in
the following pages will show. Evcn in its incomplete state, it is an enduring
monument of unboimdcd patience and researeh. Will Ireland, with her ample
resources and able hands, never muster spirit sufficient for such a work P But
first, national muninicnts must receive some consideration, and she must ecase
to enjoy the unenviable distinction of posscssing the least cared-for, worst-
kept records in Europe

To the Rev. Dr. Todd, the Rev. Robert King, and Mr. William Millar‚
who read the proofs of this work, the editor owes his grateful acknowledg-
ments for the patience with which they have performed their part, and the
valuable suggestions which they have made.

The Dublin University Press has fully maintained, in the execution of the

⁸¹ Oriyines Paroa-hiulca Semina—Vol. i. was
published in 1851; vol. ii. part 1, in 1854; and
vol. ii. part z, in 1855. The two first volumes
bear the signature os C. Innes3 the third, that
of James B. Brichan. lt is greatly to be re-
gretted that the work has come to a stand

still; and it is to be feared that, if the present
editors be allowed to pass away, leaving the
task unfmislaed, no future time will raise up
successors possessing qualifications equal to
those now avallable in furtherance of this
great national object.
