both 10 time and place, to draw from authentic sources, for in his boyhood² he
had frequent opportunities of conversing with those who had seen St. Columba,
and he was now writing almost 011 the very spot where his great predecessor
had indited his last words, and surrounded by objects every one of which was

mentary materials, he had before him the account of Cummene the Fair, whom
he cites by 113111οἕ, and whose entire narrative he has transferred, almost ver-
batimh‚ into his own compilation, where it is for the most part incorporated
with the third book. He had also another memoiri, on the authority of which
he relates 311 occurrence not recorded in Cummene’s pages. Besides these com-
positions, which were written in Latin, there existed in our author’s day
certain poems on the praises of Columba, in the Scotic tongue, among which
was probably the celebrated A mhrak, or panegyric, which was written by a oon—
temporary of the Saint. Baithene Mor¹, who enjoyed St. Columba's frkndship,

account of certain appearances which that
monk observed on the night of St. Columba's
death, at which time his informant was an
adult-iii. 23 (238).
