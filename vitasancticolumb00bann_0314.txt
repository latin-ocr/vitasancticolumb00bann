p. 523.) He was sometimes called senior Bren-
danus, to distinguish him from Brendan of

Bior (see note (ἲ, p. 52, sapum Colg. Tr. Th. p.
396 a, c. 46). The monastery of Birr, so called

from the stream on which it stood, grew in
after times into a town bearing the same name,
for which Parsonstown is a modern substitute..
Birr is set down by Keating as a boundary of
ancient Meath (vol. i. p. 128, ed. Haliday). It
was formerly part of Eile &Car-roll, in Mun-
ster, but is now at the S. W. extremity of the
King's County, in minster, ‘⁴ in ipso Hiberniae
meditulli0.” (Ussher, Wks. vi. p. 5²3-)

ι’ Brendeui.-Mentioned already 'm cap. 3
(p. ¹9³) supra. He was son of Neman ancl
Manusena, and was one of the race of Corb
Aulam, great-grandson of Rudhraighe, the
founder of the Clanna. Rudhraighe (O'Flafflerty,
Ogyg. p. 274). Ussher in one place (Ind.
Chron. 57 ι) erroneously calls himfilius Luaiy-
nei, but elsewhere he correctly writes ⁴⁴ Neimi
sive Nemaiudi clari poetae filius.” (Wks. vi.

Clonfert, son of Finnlogh, and is spoken of as
“Brandanus Biorra, qui Propheta in scholis
illis, et etiam sanctorum Hiberniensium habe—
batur-''—Vit. Finniani, c. ¹9 (Colg. Aet. SS. p.
395 ιι). His acts are preserved in the Cod.
Salmant., from whichColgan published the por-
tion relating to st. Columba (Tr. Th. p. 462 a.
n. 44). The date of his founding the church os
Birr is not recorded, but Tighernach, at 559,
has this curious entry: Ascensio Brenaiud in
curru suo in aerem. His death is entered in
Tighernach at 565 and 573 ; in the Au. Ult. at
564 and 571; and in the An. Inisfall. at 565.
The later date in Tighernach seems preferable.
Ussher and the Four Mast- fix the event at 57¹·
He died on the night before the 29th of No-
vember, which is his day in the Calendar, in
the eightieth year of his age.
