St. Columba visited Ireland¹ subsequently to June, 585, and from Durrow pro-
eeeded westwards to Clonmacnffis, where he was received with tho warmest tokens of
affection and respect.

In 593 he seems to have been visited with siekness‚ and to have been brought near
death. Such, at least, may be supposed to be the moral of hjs alleged declarationy
concerning the angels who were sent to conduct his soul to paradise, and whose ser>

Of his various qualities, both mental and bodily, Adamnan gives a brief but ex-
pressive summaryb. Writing was an employmcnt to which he was much devoted.
Adamnan makes special mentionc of books written by his hand3 but from the way 111
which they are introduced, one would be disposed to conclude that the exereisc eon-

be found in the following pagcs⁹. There are also in print‘ his “ Farcwel to Aran,'' a
