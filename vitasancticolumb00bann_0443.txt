Commius life was considered a special militia Christi (61, 118), and they who
adopted it were looked upon as Christi milites (22, 2 36, passim), in reference to their
Leader, and commilitones (77, 142, 144, 196) as regarded onc another. Eaeh one
professed 1115 readiness Deo eoelze‘bere hostiam (61), by withdrawing from the cares of the
world, and awillingness to enter it only as an athleta Christi (vit. Munnae) in ‘the pro-
pagation of the Gospel (Bede, 111. 3). The society, termed coenobc'alis eoez‘us (12), or
collegium monachorum (Bede, iii. 5), consisted essentiauy of an Abbot and Family.

St. Brendan's case was precisely similar: he founded
Clonfert, and was presbyter-abbot of it from 564
till his death in 577. St. Moenu, οι· Maeinenn, was
bishop of the same church during the founder‘s lise-

time, and died in 572. In Armagh the chief dig-
nity, namely⁷ that of Coarb anatrick, was conven-
tual, aud the abbot was occasionally distinguished
from the bishop who was his subordinate. See

who never rose from the presbyterate3 of St. Gall,
who twice refused the most ear-nest solicitations to
become a bishop (V it. S. Galli, Messingham‚ Florileg.
