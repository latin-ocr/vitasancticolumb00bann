Of the Subsequent history of the island little more is known than the names and
dates of occasional possessors¹¹‚ from 1292 onwards, till we come to 1703, when we are
refreshed by the interesting repert of the honest and judieious explorer of the Western
Islands. speaking of the religious remains at Egg, this writer says: “ There is a
heap of Stones here, called Martia Dessil, i. e. a Plaee consecrated to the Saint of that
Name, about which the Natives oblige themselves to make a Tour round Sunways.”
Again, “ There is a Chureh here on the East side of the Isle, Dedicated to St. Domum,
whose Anniversary they observe. About thirty yards from the Chureh there is a
Sepuleliral Urn under ground; it is a big Stone hewn 10 the bottom, about four feet
deep, and the Diameter of it is about the same breadth 3 1 eaus'd 'em to (lig the ground
above it, and we found a flat thin Stone eovering the Urn; 11 was almost full of Hu-
mane Bonos, but no Head among them, and they were fair ancl dry. 1 enquir'd of the
Nativos what was become of {he Heads. and they could not teu3 but one of them said,
perhaps their Heads had been eut off with a two-handed Sword, and taken away by the

south West end, is in great esteem by the Natives, for St. Domum is the celebrated
Tutelar of this Isle. The Natives do not allow Protestants to come 1ο their Bmdaw,

The other chureh of St. Donnan, alluded to in the [rish Calendars, is situate in
Sutherland, adjoining Caithness, and gives name to the parish of B’z'ldonan. It stood
on the bank of the Helmsdale river, aneiontly the Iligh, in the valley, called from it
Stroth Iligh. In this parish “there was a large. hollow stone, situated about 3 miles
from the ehurch, and about midway between it and Helmsdale, which was called. Sut'yh

Plaee. The tradition is, that the saint sat down in it, to rest himself, when passing
through the Strath of Kssdonan’'r.

Another ehureh, where St. Dommn’s memory was held ’111 great veneration, was
Auchterless, an inland parish of Aberdeenshire. Here his pastoral staff was preserved,
