He was also fourth in a succession of Fintans
who were abbots of Cluaineidhneach, or Clo-
nenagh, in Queen's County. (Colgan, Aet. SS.
p. 356 a.) The parish of Taghmon in West-
meath likewise derives its name from him. His
principal church in Scotland was Kihnond, now
Kilmun in Cowass, 20 which the Breviary of
»aberdeen assigns his burial (Propr. SS. Part.
Estiv. fol. 132 αα); where local tradition even
marks the supposed place ofhis sepulture by
the name of sith-Mun (Old Stat. Survey⁷ vol.
ii. p. 383); and where a half-markland was
held in virtue of the custody of his erosier.
(Innes, Orig. Paroeh. vol. ii. pt. i. p. 72.) The
old pai-ish of Elanmunde, on the confines of
Argyle and Inverness, derived its name from
an island in Loeh Leve-n, on which there was a
church called aster S. Mund. (Ibid. p. 170.)
