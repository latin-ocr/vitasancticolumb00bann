E. and W„ and 11, N. and S.; and having,
within‚the traces of three distinct chambers or
compartments. It was surrounded by a cy-
elopean cashel, the north face of which is the
most perfect, and is, in parts, nearly 8 feet
thick. This was probably “the Tower'' which
a writer of the seventeenth century describes
as existing here (C. Innes, Orig. Paroch. vol. ii.
pt. 1, p. 349). Near to this, on the S. WVq is a
quadrilateral building, standing N. and S., mea-
suring about 30 by 10 feet. About 120 yards
S. of the cashel is the Temple, facing E. N. E..
measuring 21 feet 10 inches by 122, now com-
monly employed as an enclosure for cows. The
roof has long fallen in, and the walls, which are
built with cernent, are reduced to the height
of about five feet. The adjacent ground is
covered with masses of large gray stones, the
debris of the walls, so that it is impossible to
examine the area where one would expect to
find traces of the cemetery. lt may be that
some curious sepulchral remains are locked up
there. At short distances are patches ofground
covered with gray stones, which appear to have
been the sites osconventual buildings, probably
of ‘¹ the Τοῖνι]Π mentioned by an old writer,
and of ⁴⁴ the ruins of some buildings composed
of stone without mortar,'' which were to be
seen in 1772 (Orig. Par. ut supra). Mugsted‚
recte Monkstead, is the name of the adjoining
farm.

main road to Portree, where Skabost bridge
crosses the Snizort river, near its entrance
into Loch Snizort Bay, is a long narrow strip

the remains os two ancient buildings. standing
within a large cemetery; that next the bridge
much the longer of the two, and probably the
old parish church; that more remote, ofsmaller
dimensions, chiefly worthy of notice on account
ofa curicus slab embedded in the floor, exhi-
biting the figure of an armed warrior. The
parish chureh, now known as Snizort, was for-
merly styled sanct Cvlm‘s Kirk ιἰι Sncqfurd in

ΙΠ- Proceeding southwards we reach Port-
ree, the inner bay of which, N. W. of the town,
was formerly called, as some old people remem-
ber, Loch columkille. Here, near the shore,
under the Sheriff's house¹ is a small island
still called Eilecm columkille, about an eighth
ofa mile in circumference at high water. lt
is nearly covered with stones, which were
spread upon it for the drying of sea-wrack,
and kilns for burning kelp, so that the soil is
nearly hidden. However, the traces os graves,
and of a small building standing E. and W..
may be discerned3 and some old people rc-
member one or two interments on the islct.

w. On the small island, Eilean Trody, called
Troda by Mart‘m (West. Isl. p. 166), Iying off
the north of Kilmuir, was a chapel of St. Co-
lumba.

v. On Fladda Huna, called by MartinFlmlaela-
chuan, which lies N. W. of last, there stood, in
1700, a chapel named from St. Columba, having
on the altar a blue stone, which was supposed
to be possessed of miraculous powers. (Ibat)
