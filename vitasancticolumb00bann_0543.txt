tibus fidem Christi perceperint.'' On the other hand, Tighernach the annalist, in
recording the death of the above Conall, addS‚ qui obtulit insulam Ia Oolaim-cz'lle ,· and
the same assertion is in the Annals of fflster. Irish authorities, however, are not
unanimous : the Liber Hymnorum, a most venorable witness (17, 260), when treating
of St. Columba's mission to Alba, states : Bruz'di autem filius Ilstlclcon reyebat Pictos tunc,
et ipse mmolam'th Columbo hl, ubi Columb cum esset armorum lxxvii. sepultas est (p. 21).
It 15 a thousand years since those words were written 111 that book! Now, in weigh-
ing this evidence, there are collateral considerations to be taken into account :—1. The
Fergusian colony was only fifty-seven years settled ’111 Britain when St. Columba
arrived, and therefore was not likely either to have acquired much strength, or to have
pushed its dominions much beyond its original bounds3 but Hy lies far to the north,
and is, moreovcr, at the remote side of a large, independent, island. 2. A very valiant
prince, and. as Bcde designatos him, rex potentissimue, now governed the Picts, and
that the Scots had not been uniformly successful, even 111 their own side of the country,
appears from the cntry in Tighernach at 560: bopp 5011110111 mcii> Domongmpc 1¹¹

of th(¹ Annals of Ulster brings 11110 close connexion, Mors Gabrain mic Domanqairt,

rank of Conall as a prince was of a subordinate nature, appears from the term coweuch
applied to him by the Four Mastcrs at 565: which word dcnotes in Irish only lord',
in the fourth grado of authority. Further, in evidence of the limited mle of Conall,
may be mentioned his pecho, or predatory expedition, with Colman Beg, to the Western
Isles (Chron. Hyens. 568), an exploit which 110 would hardly have undertaken in his
own dominions. 4. Finally, if Hy were at this time inside the Dah'iadie territory, the
(lonation of it would rest rather with the chief of the house of Lom, who were tho
nearest neighbours, than with the chief of the house of Comghall, whose district lay at
a considerable distance to the south-east. Of the previous occupation of Hy, whether
by two bishops, according to the Irish Life& or by Goman, according to Fordun (418);

often used in this sense in the Book of Asmagh (fol.
9αα, 10 bb, 11 ba, 16αα, 17 αα); 50 also, in the
chron. Pictor.‚ “immolavit Nechtonius Aburnethige
[Abemethy] Deo et S. Brigidae” (Pinkert. Enq. 1.
493} Ir. Nennius, p. 162). This nse of the word
seems peculiar to Celtic Latin, sor Du Gange has
but one authority sorit, and that from aWelsh chal-ter

inthe Monost. Anglican. See Usshen Iud. Chr. 604,

ἰ Lord.—See O'Flaherty,Ogyg.Parsi.(p.27.) In
more modern times, the Scotch had an officer in the
territory called Tossachdoir (Orig. Paroch. ii. p. 5),
which is interpreted ‘ crowner' (ibt p. 97), and whose
office was tei-med Toseachdeora (ib. p. 17z; Chal-
mers, Calednn. i, p. 451).
