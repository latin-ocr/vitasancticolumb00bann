θ Tiyhernis.-A Latin transformation of the
Irish noun tlssepno, ί a lord'-proving that the
δ in the word is a radical letter3 and pointing
to (ιδ, ‘ a house‚’ as the derivation, like dominus
from domus, rather than to τύραννος, which
O'Brien proposes. In the narrative these
princes are called reyii yeneris viri and no-
biles viri. In the Lives of the Irish Saints
Dux is the usual representative of the word.
The founder of Clones was called Tiylmrnaclz.
“quia multorum dominorum et regum nepos
estff’ (Act. SS. Apr. tom. i. p. 401.) The word
appears in the old Welsh form of tiyirn, and the
Cornish teyrn, as also in the proper names
Guorthiyern‚ Euliyern, Tiurnan, Μιιεῖιίεννι.
(Zeuss, Gram. Celt. i. pp. 100, 151, 158, 162.)
