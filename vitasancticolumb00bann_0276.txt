(p. 174) insra, the former of which is Du Cange's
only authority for rosetus. or roseta, which he
interprets ⁴‘ paxillus ferreus‚” commonly called
the linch-pin. or in Irish bessl5-n01ele01n. But
it rather means a large nut 01· box fastened on
the end of the axle. 'she construction was af-
terwards changed, and the block wheel was in-
troduced, where the axle was firmly flxed in
the wheels, and revolved with them. Cams
thus made are still common in Ireland.

¹· Culumbannsfilius Ec1¹1udi.-The connexion
of this Columbanus (or Colmanus, as the name
is more generally written, vid. note ff, p. 29,
supra) with the monastery mentioned in the
text, is noticed also in the Life os St. Fechin
os Fore: “Perrexit quodam die S. Pechinus
ad locum. qui Snamh-luthir dieitur, in regione
dc Carbre gabhra. Et cum ibi offendisset Col-
manum filium Eochadii a longo tempore oculis
captum, aqua, qua suas manns lavit. ad oculos
ejus admota, et aspersa, eum perfectissime
visus beneficio reslonavit.·'—capr 30 (Act. SS.
p. 136 b). St. Pechin died in 665, so that this
occurrence was of a much later date than that
in the text, at which time Colman was probably
a youth: at least his employment with St. Co-
lumba, and his condition when visited by St.
Fechin, indicate the opposite extremes of life.
lt may be observed here that St. Fechin is
stated in his Life to have had an interview
with Adamnan, and that the ancient author
declares he was informed of it by Adamnnu
himselR—cap. 47 (Act. SS. p. ¹39 a) This
