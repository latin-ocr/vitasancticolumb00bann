Memoir of St. Aclamnan. lvii
gratia disponente, ut vir unitatis ac pacis studiosissimus ante ad vitam raperetur {cter-
nam, quam redeunte tempore paschali, graviorem cum eis qui eum ad veritatem sequi
nolebant, cogeretur habere discordiam.'' This was, according to the Irish Annals, in
the year 704: in which tho rcformed Easter fell on the 30th of March. He died on
the 23rd of Septembe1·¹‘, which is the day of his commemoration both in the Irish and
Sootoh calendars.

Of the character of Adamnan sor learning and the graces of the Christian mi-
nistry‚ we have the highest testimony in the contemporary statements of Bcde and
Ccolfrid. Aleum, later in the same century, ranks him with Columba and Comgall, in
the well-known epigram¹—

“ Patritius, cheranus, Scotorum gloria gentis,
Atque Columbanus, Cougallus, Adomuauus atque,
Praeclari patres, morum vitaeque magistri,
His precibus pietas horum nos adjuvet omnes.”

In a later age, Fordunm, in addition to the trite commemoration, “virtutibus pollens
et mi1·acu]is,⁷’ says of his literary fidelity, “ quando historias et res gestas conscripsit,
de more semper habuit auctorem suum in testimonium adducere.'’ Tho Irish, of
course, are loud 111 1115 praises. In ‘the Vision he is styled the ‘noble suge of the
western world‘¹¹‚ and his Life ascribes to him the combined virtues of Patriarchs and
Apostles, while the Four Masters sum up the evidence thus: “ Adamnan was a good
man, according to the testimony of St. Beda, for he was ἰωή-111, penitent, given to
prayer, diligent, ascetie, temperate ; he never used to eat except on 81111113)Υ and Thurs-
day ; he made a slave of himself to these virtues; and, moreover, he was wisc and
learned in the clear understanding of the Holy Scm'ptures of God.'' Yet he. was not
without his temptations, and there is a eurious coincidence between his Irish Life, and
the Lessons in the Brevi-ary of Aberdecn as to the manner in which the enemy made
his assathS, namely, in human form, and with knotty, diabolical questi0ns⁰. The phi-

this he is followed by Casimir Oudin (Comment. de
script. Eccl. vol. i. col. 1666, Lips. 1722) Oudin,
however, avoids two other blunders os Cave, where
the latter states that Surius published Adamnan's
Life of St. Columba·⁷ and that Sex-arius was the first
editor os the tract De Locis Terrae Sanctae.

The Irish Life states that “the demon came 111 hu·

Munster compelled him by force to come to Adam-
nan. And he came with many hard questions.
One of the questions was, Was it iu shape or with-
