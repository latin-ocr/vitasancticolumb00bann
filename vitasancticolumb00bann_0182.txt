78 Vita Sancti Columboe

[tm. 1.

per diem se occultare conatur, ut noctu ad parvam transnaviget insulam‘ ubi
marini nostri juris vitulig generantur et generant3 ut de illis ¹³furenter occisis
edax valde furax suam replens naviculam, ad suum repedet habitaculum. Qui
haec audientes, obsecuti, emigrant, furemque in locis a Sancto praesignatis
absconsum reperiunt, et ad Sanctum, sicut illis praeceperat, perduxerunt.
Quo viso Sanctus ad eum ¹⁴dicit, Quare tu res alienas, divinum transgressus
mandatum, saepe furaris Ρ Quando neeesse habueris, ad nos veniens necessaria
accipies postulata. Et haee dicens praeeipit ¹⁵verveeesh occidi, et pro ¹⁶phocis

the entrance of Loeh na Keal, on the west side
of Mull. Of these the latter lies nearer to Hy,

1st, it is likely Colosa was an inhabited island,
which Little Colonsay is not; znd, there would
be no advantage gained by crossing l'rom Little
Colonsay, because the islands on that side are
nearer to it than to the shore⁷ and his object in
landing was to be near his work3 3rd, there
are no “ campuli mari vieini” or “arenarum
eumuli” ou the west coast of Mun near Hy.
The name occurs again at ii. 22, where the
larger island seems to be again intended.
‘Insulam—Most probably Erraid Isle, the
largest of a little group of islands at the south
entrance of the Sound, south-east of Hy, and
close to the shore of Mull. Immediately oppo-
site to this island the sand is abundant on the
shore of Mull, but the coast is iren-bound
higher up, and so continues for 3 long distance.
The course from Colonsay was north-west, sor
about thirteen miles. The stranger landing on
the near end of Mull could then eonveniently
oross over to the seal island. Selsey in Sussex
was anciently called ⁴¹ selaeseu, quod dieitur La-
tine Insula Vituli marini? (Bede, H. E. iv. 13.)

The Irish term is pon. These animals are
frequently seen on the islands in the neigh-
bourhood, but not so regularly or in such num-
bers as to constitute a preserve. Martia, writ-
ing in 1703, states thatin Harris seals “are eat
by the meaner people, who say they are very
nourishing'‘ (West. Islands, p. 36). On west
coast os Harris is the island Eousmil, a roek,
where 15 a yearly fishing of seals, which belong
to the adjacent landholders. The parish mi-
nister has his choice of all the young seals, and
that which he takes is called cullen Mory, i. e.
the Vix-gin Mary’s Seal. So many as 320 have
been killed at one time. The natives salt the
fish with the ashes of burnt sea-ware. People
ofdistinction eat the hams only. (lbid. pp. 61-
65.) See Hardiman's edition of O'Flaherty’s
West Connaught, pp. 27, 95, 96.

abstemiousness os St. Columba appear to be
without foundation. See Praef. 2 (p. 9) supra.
