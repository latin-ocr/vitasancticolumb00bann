Memoz'r ofSt. Adamnan. xli
the pai-ish or province which gave him birth, there is good reason for supposing that
110 was a native of that part of the territory occupied by the racc of ConalL called Tir-
Aedhah‚ and now familiarly known as the barony of Tirhugh, in 1110 south-west of 1110
county of Donegal. Here was settled the elan from which he sprung, and here wns
also one of his prineipal commemoratione, preserving a vivid 1000110011011 011115 011011οκ.
His father, Ronan¹‚ was sixth in deseent from Couall Gulbanm, the head of 0110 of 1110
two great raees of the N orthern Hy-Nein, and, in virtue of his birth, claimed lsin 10
St. Columba, and many of the sovereigns of Ireland. The father of Bonan was Tinno,
from whom came the patronymie Ua Temen, or ‘grandson of Tinne‚’ an appellativo
Which is occasionally found eoupled with Adamnan’s 1101110, Ronnat0, 1110 mother of
Adamnan, was deseended from Enna, a son of N iall, whose racc, 1110 Cz‘nel Enna, pos-
sessed themselves of the tract lying between the channels of 1110 F oyle and Swffly,
which was called the T z'r-Enna, or ‘ land of Enna,’ and answcrs to 1110 modom barony

of Raphoe.

bor, mors, the Chron. Scotor. reads 50111, nativi-
tas. Lanigan (Eccles. Hist. iii. p. 153) prefers the
date 627, because he finds the age of 77 assigned to
Adamnan, and 6244 77 only equal to 701, whereas
704 is the date ofhis death. Mac Firbis's MS. An-
nals state his age at 783 the date, however, as giren
in the Annals, is not to be hastily set aside. Ward
wigns his birth to 626 (Rumam, p 218).

h Tir-Aedluz.—That is, ‘the land of Aedh,’ so
called from Aedh, son of Ainmire, who, in common
with Adamuan, was of the Siol Setina, or descend-
ants of Sedna, grandson of Conall Gulban (Geneal-
Table, p. 342), one brauch of whom, namely, the
Cinel Luighdeeh, occupied the present barouy of
Kilmaerenan (p. 192), and another, the barony of
Tirhugh (p. 38).

ἱ Gommemorations.-T11e church os Drumhome,
of which Adamnau was patron. See the interesting
mention of it at p. 238, where it is almost implied
that Adamnan was, in his boyhood, living in that
neighbourhood.

¹¹ Recolleceion ofln's abode.—Ward, in reference
to a well in the paris-h of Drumhome, says: ‘⁴ Vidi
qui ex loco quodam Dabhaclz Adamlmain, ubi
Sanctus pernoctabat in aquis, vimina ad restem
nendum abstulisset, contemptis Sancti nomine et
asylo, et mox rabiosa febre con-entus, eadem
nocte interiit furibundus, exiliens manibus grabato,

Here was situate the ancient ehureh of Rath-bothv, said to have beon

uti quodam agitatus dxemoness' In the marginal
note he explains Damiach Adamlumin by Lava-
crum Adamnanz', and adds “clarus miraculis sons
