held in vent-ration by the other sex (1 12, 159, 163), there can be no doubt that eeli-
bacy was strictly enjoined 011 his community‚ and the condition, “ virgo
(vastitas. corpore et virgo mente'’7, held up for imitation. Hence we find a monk
discharging an office usually assigned to women (125), and hence the total
absence of anything like hereditary succession in the abbacy of Hy. A learned and
ingenious writer in a modern journal² has proved to a demonstration, from the native
Annalists‚ that a lineal succession of abbots existed in many of the Irish monasteries
during the ninth and following centuries‚ but he has failed to include the eoarbs of Co-
lumba 111 the class3 and a comparison of his premises with the Genealogical Table
which accompanies this Note vn’ll show that he has mistaken names for perizon&⁴ Mar-
riagc, no doubt, existed among the 500111111- clergy⁸³y but the practice seems to have been
disapproved of by the regulars: and thus we may qualify the story told of St. Com-
gall’s preceptor: “ Quadam nocte cum Clericus ille cum muliere dormisset⁷'¹‘; and
Admnnan’s narrative of the clericus of Magh Breg, “dives et honoratus in plebe,'' who
died “ curn meretrice in eodem lectulo eubans'⁷ (7 5).
In thcir intercourse with one another, the monks of this order appear to have been
xirtually regulated‘by the precept of Columbanus, “Cum cautela et ratione loquendum
est'⁷⁶. Of such reserve the anecdote told of the monks and Baithene (72)
Tmaurnitas. affords an example. Between the abbot and the brethren there seems to
have been no restraint (168, 208) 3 and as regards the society at large, the
objects of their system were too praetioal, and their engagements too much character-
ized by common sense, to impose any restraint in conversation but such as condueed
to the purity or decorum of the members.
Another monastic principle was Humility, which was exemplified both in de·
meanour towards superiors, and in dejection after sin. A visitor 011 bendcd knees
bowed down before the founder (203), and his successor (20); aud even
[summm. before a subordinate senior the brethren made known their wishes upon their
knees (72)· The penitent fell on his knces weeping (59). St. Benedict's

the former was son of Tiune of the house of Nathi.
son of Conau Gulban3 the latter, son of Alta of the
house of Pergus, son of Conan Gulban.

Failbhe was a very common name, and the father
of Conamhail cannot have been identical with
abbot Failbhe, because the former was of the Clann
Colla. See note ¹, supra. Again, Dorbene, father
of F aelchu, was very different from Dorbene Fada:
