The history of the manuscript is interesting. It was undoubtedly written
in the west3 and was probably taken to Germany in the early part of the
niuth century. The corrections of the Irish orthogmphy, and the peculiar
hand of the corrector, indicate a foreign revision, and at the period mentioned. ¹
The monasteiy of Augia Dives or Reichenau‘, where the book was found at
the beginning of the serentecnth century, was au ancient monastery much fre-
quented by the Irish, and its abbot, from 842 to 849, was the celebrated
Walafridus Strabus, who had been previously Dcan of St. Gall, another 1non-
astery of Irish connexion. At the beginning of the ninth century a strong
tide of Irish pilgrims set in towards Germanyu ; possibly caused by the N orse
invasions ofthe west3 and it is likely that the breaking up of Hy, at the same
time, and by the sanie influence‚ caused many menibers of the Columbian
society to fall in with the movement. There undoubtedly was solne such
cornnuinicntion between Ireland and eastern Germany soon after 825, whereby
walafridus Stralnls, who records the martyrdom of St.Blaithmac, was made
acquainted with the particulars of that tragical eventv. St. F intan, the patron

landers, is reported to be still in existence.
The valuable relies of the library were carried

to prevent their falling into the hands of the
Government (Baden).

¹¹ Germany.-The observation of Walafridus
Strabus, in his Life of St. Gall, is very much to
the purpose: “ Nuper quoque de natione Sco-
torum, quibus consuetudo peregrinandi jam
pene in naturam conversa est, quidam adve-
nientes,'' &c.—ii. 46 (Messingham‚ Florileg.
p. 293 α). This was written before 842.

v Trayical event.—1t is a remarkable circum-
stance to find an occurrence which so deeply
affected St. Columba’s society very briefly no—
ticed in domestic records, and to be obliged to
trave] to eastern Germany for further particu-
lars. See p. 389, infra.
