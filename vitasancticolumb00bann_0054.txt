borrowed these lines, was of a prior date. Now as Alexander ΙΙ. reigned
from 1214 to 1249, it is evident that he cannot be intended; Alexander I.‚
therefore, whose reign was from 1107 to 1 124, is the subject of the metrical
colophon.

The applicability of the 10th and 11th verses to this sovereign is con-
firmed by Fordun, who, having stated the circumstances which led to the
foundation of Inch Colum by Alexander I. (p. 298, infra), adds& ‘⁶ Tum etiam
quia Sanctum Columbam semper a juventute speciali venerabatur honore 3 tum
insuper, quia parentes ipsius per aliquot annos infoeoundi, sobolis solatio erant
destituti, donec devotione supplici Sanctum Columbam imploranteS, gloriose
consecuti sunt quod tam anhelo desiderio diu quaesiemnt.” What is even
more to the point, Fordun, in the preceding chapter, says of the same king,
‘⁶ Erat itaque in construendis ecclesiis, et reliquiis Sanctorum perquirendis,
in vestibus sacerdotalibus librisque sacris conficiendis et ordinandis studio—
sissi1nus.'' The reyina mentioned in the 17th verse was Alexander's queen,

Sibillaf, who died at Loch Tay, 3 Id. J ul. 1122. Alexander’s mother, St.
Margaret, was a great benefactor of Hy33 and his brother had been abbot
of St. Columba’s monastery of Dunkeld. The ll'z’llelmas of the 24th verse
was probably the WVilhehuus, Bishop of the Isles‚ who, according to the Chro-
nicle of Manh, succeeded Roolwer, and on whose death in 1 114, Hamond, 01·
Wymund, was consecrated to the see. This would limit the composition
of these lines to the interval between Alexander-'s accession in 1107, and
Bishop William’s death in 1114.

The following are the principal peculiarities of this manuscript: It in-
variably calls Hy, ioucz insula* ; but when in the 24th hexameter it uses
the Hebrew name of St. Columba, it writes iona .· It uses no capitals with
proper names ε It often prefixes s to initial c, as sceleritas for celerius .· It uses
e for ae and ae: It writes περιστερά, ΠΗΡΥΟΤΗΡΑ; It uses the adjective

generally under the days of May and June, ity sor the early names under the Bishops of
and the volume seems to have been one of a the Isles‚ p. 296 (Edinb. 1824). The Chron-
great manuscript series of Acta Sanctorum sor icon places Hamondus “in diebus Godredi
