‘Causa quare voluit Deum laudare‚’ i. e.
to besec-eh forgiveness for the three battles
which he had caused 111 Erin, viz„ the.
battle of Cul-Rathain‚ between him and
Comgau, contending for a chureh, viz„
Ross-Torathair ; and the battle of 1101110811-
fheda of the weir of Clonard; and the bat-
tle of CuJ-Dremhne in Connaeht: audit
was against Diarmait mae Cerball he fought
them bothv.

As tlie battle of Cul-Dremhne arose in part fiom a religious djspute with St. Fin-

nian, so that of Cul-Rathain or Coleraineq is described as the result of a quarrel with
St. Comgall of Bangor. The medem name of Ros-Torathair is not known, but the
place was somewhere near Coleraine; and it is very possible that some. colhsion did

camus-‚r was situata elose to Coleraine, and St. Columba is recorded to have been ocea-
sionally in that neighbourhood& Resides, the territory west os Coleraine was the
debateable ground‘ between the Dal-Araidhc, St. Comgall's kinsmen, and the Hy-Neill
of St. Columba’s tribe. Fiaehna, son of deau, with his men of the Clanna-Rudh-
raighe, are described as the benigcrents on the Dalaradian side. Now this Fiaehna
was lord of Dalamdja, and is spoken of 111 the Life of Comgauu as residing at Rath-mor
