Ι· Cruthinipopuli.·—-Cnumhne,the Irish Picts,
a name frequently given to the Dal-Araidhe.
They inhabited the southern half of the county
of Antrim, and the greater part of the eounty
of Dowu, and their territory was sometimes
called cpio no cpmcnne, ⁴ region ofthe Picts:
Mons Mis, or Sanbh ῙΠΙΓ, now Slemish, a re-
markable hill in the ceutre of the county of
Antriua, is placed by the Book of Armagh
(fol. 3 α α), and the Second and Fourth Lives
of S. Patrick in Colgan's collection (Tr. Th.
pp. 14, 39), “ in regionibus Cruidnenorum.''
Fiacha Araidhe, who gave name to the Dal
Araidhe, was, according to Tighernach‚ lord
of the Cruithne iu 236.—-Book of Lecan, fol.

Reeves' Ec. Ant. p. 337. Adamnan makes men-

the distinction which is generally observed in
the Annals of Ulster, calling the Irish Picts
Cruithnii, and the Scottish, Picti or Pie-tores.
The Life of St. Comgall says: ὃ· De aquilonali
Hiberniae regione, nomine Dail-naraidhe, quae
est contra mare in aquilonali provinciae plaga
Ultorum, sanctus abbas Comgallus ortus fuit.''
(Cod. Kilken. fol. 90 b a; Fleming, Collect. p.
303.) According to his pedigree he was ninth
in descent from Fiaeha Araidhe, the founder of
the race3 while Congal Claen, who commanded
the Dalaradians in this battle, was tenth in de-
scent from the same individual. For the his-
tory of Congal Claen, see O'Donovan·s Battle
of Magh Rath, pp. 22, 34, etc. For the place
os St. Comgall's birth, see Reeves' Eccl. Antiqq.
p. 269.

ΙΙὶῙιιηίιίο CefflirnL-—The Latin equivalent
for Dun Cerrlnpn, Dun Kehern. This forti-ess
derived its name from Cethern, son of Fintan,
one of the famous heroes of the Red Branch
who flourished in Ulster about the Christian
era. His grandfather Niall Niamhglonnach
[‘ of the shining deeds']‚ son of Ross Ruadh‚
son ofRudhraighe, ancestor ofthe ClannaRury,
had his resfflence, about five miles eastwards,
in the majestie earthen fort over the Banu,
anciently called Dun-da-bheanu [Fort of the
two peaks]‚ and now known as Mountsandal,
near the Cutts of Coleraine. (Cathreim Con-
ghail Clairingnech, p. 12, MS. R. Ir. Acad.)
Cethern‚ the founder of Dun Ceithern, oecupies
a prominent place in the ancient historical ro-
mance called the 'rain-meuailgne, in which
he is represented as coming from Dun-da-
bheann (Book of Leffister, fol. 62 α α); and
again as scut sor to earn Loig [Four Mast.
