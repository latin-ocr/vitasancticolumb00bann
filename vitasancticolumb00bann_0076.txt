vision, eoneerning the joys of heaven and the pains of hell, which Adamnstn is said to
have witnessed previous to the date of the above synod. The Ρη· (leoninum, or
Vz'sz'on of Adamnan, an Irish composition of considerable age, as is proved by its style,
is still in existence ; and though possessing internal evidence that in its present form¹²
it is not the productiori of Adamnan, it lays claim to considerable antiquity⁰, and em-
bodies a narrative which, like the visions of St. Fursap, passed current in conversation
as the realities os his expen'enee. The Visionq is a religious diseourse on the text
Psal. cxlvi. 5, 6 (Vulg.), and after some prosator-y remarks, goes on to say: “ After
this, that which is preaehed here was manifested to Adamnan Ua Tinne, the high sage
of the western world, when his soul passed from liis body on the festival of John the
Baptist‘, and when it was carried to heaven to behold the angels there, and to hell to
behold its wretched hosts.'’ Having related all that he witnessed in either abode, and
having speeially notieed in the place of torment tho “Aireinnechs, who, in the pre-
senee of the relies⁵ of the saints, administer the gifts and tithes of Godt, but who turn

These canons do not seem to have any connexion with

of the Bigot Library at Rotterdam. which formerly

Par. 1717). They exist also iu the Cotton MS. of
Canens (fol. 155 b), but with considerable varia-
tions, under the title Incipiunt canones Adomnani.
Mentiou is made at p. 179, infra, of a transcript os
theru. Besides these, there is in Mai-tene a detaehed
canon, under the title Item Adompnanus (Ιὸ. col.
1 r). It is of the same pur-port as the others, namely,
unclean fond, and it exists in the Cotton MS„ but
without Adamnan's name (Otho E. xiii. sol. 126 b).

¹· John ilie Raptim—The second part of Adam-
nan's Vision contains instructions sor averting the
mortality that was apprehended on the feast of the
Decollation of John the Baptist (Aug. 29) The
note on the Feilire of Aengus at this day states that
the Scuab α Fami! (Besom of F anad) was a plag-ue
which was to visit Ireland in the latter times, in
rex-enge for the beheading of John the Raptim, as
prophesied by C-olumcille, Moling‚ and Aireran.
The Annals of &eumaeum-e, at 550, attribute the
prediction conceming the Scuab F anait to Bec mac
