are the circular enclosures spoken of, the remains of some very early habitations.
There is no tradition of their use, but they remind one of the remark made in the Old
Stat. Acct. concerning the adjacent part of Mun :—“ There are in the parish many of
the round towers said to be Dan'mh. They are set upon the sea-coast, and in sight of

4. Garadlz-Eaelzaz'n Οιζᾳ, ‘ Gardon of young Heetor,⁷ said to take its name from
Hector M‘Lean, one of the Duairt family. It is situate near the head of Port-a-Chur-
mich, where traces said to be of 1115 house, are shown. There are the vestiges of nume-
rous little buildings in this valley, especially on the east side, near the stream which
runs down from Loch Staonaig. They appear to be very ancient.

5. Teaeh an Epsscoip, ‘ Bishop’s house,’ a small, ruinous building, situate north-east
of the Cathedral. It is mentioned by Pennant, and in the N ew Stat. Acet. (w'j. pt. 2,
p. 3 33). In Saeheyerell's time it was in good preservation.

6. The sites of the Mill and Bam, of which mention is made in Pennant (362) are
rhus alluded to by a writer in 1843 : “ There is no lake of any consequence; but on a
plain adjoining the gardens of the abbey, and surroun‘ded by small hffls, there aie ves—
tiges of a large piece of artifieial water, which has consisted of several acresy and been

and where there are the marks of a sluice, the ruins of a mill are still to be seen, which
ser-ved the inhabitants for grinding their corn.’' Speaking of a cross (probably St.
Johffs) which stood “in a field upon the west side of the church‚‘' he observes:
“ There is a very ancient ruin of the granary about the same distance west firom it that
the church is distant from it to the east'’ (New Stat. Acct. vii. pt. z, pp. 317, 3 3 5).

1. Noxth of the Cathedral, and close to the Lochan Mor on the east, is a green en]-
bankment, evidently very ancient, and apparently only a portion of the original desig-n.
Pennant says :—“ North from the granary extends a narrow flat, with a double dike
and foss 011 one side, and a single dike on the other.’' This bank, which is about
thirty-six feet wide inside, may have been intended to confine and doepen the waters
of the lake, or it may be a portion of the vallum of the original monastery, for Pennant
says, “that the whole of their religious buildings were covered on the north side by
