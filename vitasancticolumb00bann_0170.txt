¹ Artchain.-Hib. Opb ouon] “ altitudo
The name exists in Ineland, as bc-
longing to a parish in the county of Down, in
the form Ardlaeen, but has been lost in the Ethica
terra or Tiree. A spot on the north side of the
island, a. little south-east of the farm-house
of Balphetrish, is called Ardkirknisln, where a.
chapel and cemetery are known to have sor-
inerly existed. ln the farm of Kenoway, south-
west of Balphetrish‚ is a rocky space called
Kilfimzian, having faint vestiges of a small
building lying east and west. See the papei-
οη the Islantl of Tiree in the Ulster Journal of
Archaeology, vol. ii. p. 241, and map. T. Iones,
who erroneously supposed the Terra Ethica to
be Shetland (Civ. Ecel. Hist. pp. 204, 205),
seems to have been satisfied of his correct-
ness, sor he four times makes mention of “Art-
chain in Shetland.'' (Ibid. pp. 179-181.)

¹² Supra memoratus.—This refers to the titu-
lus, which the Bollandists omit. and thereby
mutilate the text. Instanees of this kind are
frequent in the course of the Life.

0 Findclzanus.—Colgan assigns his festival to
March 11, choosing that one from the five se-
veral days at which the name occurs in the

amoena.¹

Irish calendar, because on it Marian Gor-
man commemor-ates pinnehen §el oc mimo-
·neeh‚ Findchanus vit-90, purus et amarosus;
and the Martyrology ofTamhlacht, pinnchon
amc 1 pinemh, Finnchanus quisuit in anqustiis
(sive cruciatibus) diuturnis : the expressions
of suffering having reference, as he supposes,
to the visitation recorded at the close os this
chapter. (Act. SS. p. 584 b, n. 2.) Tiree was,
in early times, greatly resorted to by Irish ec-
clesiastics. Besides the immediate followers
of St. Columba, it was visited by St. Brendam
St. Cainnech‚ St. Comgall‚ St. Colmanela;
and on the present occasion St. Findehan
‘⁸ brought Aidus Niger with him from Scotia
to Britain‚'' to his monastery on the island.
Among the lowland Scoteh this saint is eom-
monly called St. Fink, and his name is pre-
served in Κίζῇηἰεήεη, a pai-ish in the island of
Mun, situate between Lochs Na Keal and Scri-
dan; which is noticed in recor-ds under the
forms Keilfeinclzen, Killinachau, and Killinclzen.
The Sancta Firmum, proposed iu the Origines
Parochiales as the patron of this parish‚ seems
scarcely possessed of equal claims with St.
Findehan. (Vol. ii. pt. i. p. 3¹4)
