lviii Appendiae to Preface.
Iosophy of these legends is, that they arose, in an imaginative ag'e, out of the prevailing
and well-founded belief in Adamnan’s learning and mental ability. Among his many
vhtues, diligence in his calling 5061115 10 have been 0116. The energy of his character
has left its impress on the traditions of the country in the many journeys which he un-
dertook, and thc synods which he held ; and he himself bears honest testimony to the
multiplicity of his labours, in the epiloguc of his tract on the Holy Placesp : ‘¹ Quae et
ego quamlibet inter laboriosas et prope insustentabiles tota die undique conglobatas
ecclesiasticas sollicitudines constitutus, vili quamvis sermone describens declaravi.”
Filial piety was another of 1115 virtues, and out of his character for it grew the legend
citcd at p. 179> infra, and the title of his Feflire, or Festology, Incipit Fez'lz're Adam-
ηαίφι oio 'mochum [for his mother] hie.

The undoubted xxi-itings of Adamnan are, his tract De Locis Sanctis& and the Vita
S. Columbae. The former, whose authorship is proved beyond all question by Bede,
opens with the following prologuc¹z “ In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti,
texere librum de locis incipio sanctis. Arc-ulfus sanctus episcopus, gente Gallus,
diversorum longe remotorum peritus locorum, verax index et satis idoneus, in Hiero-
solyinitana civitate per menses novem hospitatus, et loeis cotidianis visitationibus
peragratis, mihi Adamnano haec universa quae infra craxanda sunt, experimenta dili-
gentius perscrutanti, et primo in tabulas describenti, fidch‘ et indubitabih' narratione
dictavit, quae nunc 111 membranis brevi textu scribunturfi This interesting record is
an important item in the history of writing‚ as showing the collateral and respective
uses among the Irish of waxed tablet-s’3 and memhranes for literaiy purposcs, towards
tho close of the seventh century.

The other genuine work of Adanmnn wants the externa] evidence which the trac-t
De Locis Sanctis possessos, and bears testimony 011 certain ecclesiastic-al questions

through knowledge 01· 111 ignorance that 1116 Devil ecriture ordinaire du viii. an ixa siecle'· (ib. pp. ¹²9-

worshipped ‘?” They also relate how the Devil 11 as
brought to Hy in the shape of a corpse, to be bui-iud,
and how it rose up and spoke, putting, as the Life
says, many wonderful questions to the congrega-
tion, all of which Adamnau resolved.

ΓΙ De Locis Savzctis.-Grs÷tser's edition (Ingoldst.
1619) was printed from a MS. sent to him by Fa-
ther Rosweyd, “ex intima Holandia” (Prolegom.
p. 22). The MS. saec. viii„ which is mentioned in
note ¹, p. viii. supra, is described iu the Nouvean
Traitfi de Diplomatique as “de S. Germain des Preffs,
num. 844'' (10111.ὶὶ p. 66), “un petit iri-folio, en

132): ‘¹ ce MS. 61011 dans la biliotheque de Corbie''
(ib. p. 355). It is probably the Coi-bey MS. which
was collated by Mabillon. Besides the MSS. men-
tioned at p. viii.. there is another in the British
Museum (Cod. Cotton, Tiberius, D. v. pars ii. pp.
156 α to 184 b). It is iu writing of the fourteeuth
century, and though copied by an ignorant scribe, and
imperfect, contains some valuable various readings.
It has been collated by the editor.
