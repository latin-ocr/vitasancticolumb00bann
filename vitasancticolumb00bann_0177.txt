psalmodjae viri indubitanter traditum est. Quae scilicet vox venerabilis viri in
ecclesia cum fratribus decantantis, aliquando per quatuor stadia, hoc est, quin-
gentos passus, aliquando vero per octo, hoo est, mille passus, incomparabili
elevata modo audiebaturs. Mirum dictu! Nec in auribus eorum qui secum
in ecclesia stabant vox ejus modum humanae vocis in clamoris granditate exce-
debat. Sed tamen eadem hora qui ultra mille passuum longinquitatem stabant,
sic clare eandem audiebant vocem, ut illos quos canebat versiculos etiam per
singulas possent distinguere syllabas ε similiter ¹2enim ejus vox in auribus
prope et longe audientium personabat. Sed hoc de voce miraculum beati viri
non semper, sed. raro, accidisse comprobatur3 quod'tamen sine Divini Spiritus
gratia nullo modo fieri potuisset.

¹³Sed et illud non est tacendum quod aliquando dc tali et incomparabili
vocis ejus sublevatione juxta Brudei regis munitionemg accidisse traditur.
Nam ipse Sanctus cum paucis fratribus extra regis munitionem (lum vesperti-
nales Dei laudes ex more celebrarem quidam Magi‘, ad eos propius accedentes,
in quantum poterant, prohibere conabantur, ne de ore ipsorum diw'nae laudis
sonus inter Gentiles audiretur populos. Quo comperto Sanctus quadragesi-

s Audiebatur.—The following anecdote illus-
trative of the power of S. Columba's voice, even
in his boyhood, is told in the ancient Irish Life
preserved in the Book of Lismore, Leabhar
Breac, and Highland Society MS. z “At another
time he went to watch by a sick person. As
they were passing through a thicket, the foot
of the cleric [who attended him] slipped on the
path ς upon which he suddenly died. Columcille
put his hood under the cleric's head, thinking
that he was asleep. And he began to rehearse
his lesson. so that he was he heard by certain
nuns in their convent. The learned estimato
that there was a mile and a half between them;
and the sound ot his voice was often heard at
that distance, ut dixit .-

Son o δούα Οοῐυιῐη mlle
Πὶοῃ o binoe utu¹ ceo clem ε
Co ceno cmc ceo 'oec cernent>
Giobte neunenb eut) bu peili.

⁴ The snund of the voice of colum-cille,
Great its sweetness above all clei-ies:
To the end os fifteen-hundred paces,
'l‘nough great the distance, it wus distinctly heard.v ⁰

ἓ Brudei reyis munitionem—From ii. 33 ue
learn that this was situate near the north-east
end of Loch Ness. In ii, 35 an account is given
ofthe Saint's firstjouruey to Brudms, to which
it is probable that the present anecdote isto be
referred. See the notes there.

¹¹ Celebraret.-So, at the close of his life.
“ Sanctus ad vespertinalem Dominicae noctis
missam ingreditur eeclesiam.''-—iii. 23, itgsra.

ἰ Mayi.—'rhis is the Latin word always used
in the acts of the Irish saints as equivalent
to the vernacular torm Οῃαοιύθ, Druids, or
Όῐιωύ, as in earlier compositions. Thus, in the
Irish MS. of St. Paul's Epistles, at Wurtzburg,
the gloss on Jannes and Jamhres (2 Tim. iii. 8)
