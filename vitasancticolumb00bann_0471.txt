m] Additional Note-3. 365

As in the associate monasteries there were praepositi (59, 60, 65, 127), who were
subject to the abbot-in-chief, or archimandrite, so 111 Hy there appears to have been
an offieer who assisted tho abbot (72), when he was at home, and took his
place in the administration, when he was absent. He was sometimes
called Custos monasterie, sometimes OEconomus, and his Irish name was
Ῐὲθῐῐ 121δηῖ. The obit of 0110 oeconomus of Hy is recorded (47 n.)‚ whom the Four Mas-
ters style ppiom (A. O. 777).

A member of the society is occasionally recorded under the title of Bishop (Ult.
711). Sometimes the fimetion was associated with that of Scribe (F. M. 961, 978);
sometimes with ‘the condition of Anchore'z‘e (ib. 964), and, in one instance,
with the office of Abbot (ib. 978). At a much later period we meet with Episcopus*
the office of Sugopc mop, ¹ Grcat Priest'⁰ (Ult. 1164), which might, from
the generie application of mem-dos, be supposed to express the idea of Bt‘xhsol), but it
rather seems to denote the pn‘est. whose sanctity or other qualifications gave him preec-
dence among the presbyter-s of the society.

Expertness in writing was considered an aecomplishment in the founderp (9, 2 33),
and an important qualification in his successor (ς 3, 2 33). Dorbene, the abbot elect
in 713, was the writer of Cod. A„ and probably had been scribe of the
monastery. So honourable was the employment, that the title is frequently
added to enhanee the celebrity of an abbot or bishop. In 961, the bz'slzop
of the [slas ofAlbaq was a Γοῐιιὸηιὸ, ‘ scribe’ (F. Mast.); the abbot ony, in 797, was
a pepibfieoip 0030100, ‘ ehoiee seribe’ (F. Mast.), andy in 978, a scribe and bishop
(ἰὰ). Generally, however, the offiee was a distinet one; and when, in aster times, in-
struction in literature was added to the practice and teaehing of penmanshjp, the mort·
honourable name of pepbelssiun (vir lectionis), 01· praelector, was adopted (Ult. 1164).
