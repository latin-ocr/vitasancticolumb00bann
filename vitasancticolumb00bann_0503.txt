Son of Criehan. He was not only eoarb of Columcille and Adamnan, but a bishop, lector
of Armagh, and coarb designate of St. Patrick. In 1007 he retiret] from the presidency of th<-
Columbian orden and became a reeluse. He died on Saturtlay night, the 28th of December,
101 ι, and was interred with great honour before the altar of the chureh of Armagli. Under
his presidency Maelbrighde Ua Rimhedha was abbot of Hy. The clergy of Armagh appear, at
this period, to have exereised considerable influence in the Columbian appointments.

appointment was made by the authorities assemhled in the great sair of Teltown (194). nis
local title was Abbot ofKeIls, which seems to have been the highest Columbian dignity at this
period. We have no statement of his descent, but it seems to have been from the Cinel Couaill.

the absence of the express name of any other successor in the interim, one might feel dispo—ed
to identify with this ecclesiastic, but that the death os the latter is recorded at 1009.
