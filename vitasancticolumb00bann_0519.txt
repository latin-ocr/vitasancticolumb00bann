The passage here cited is tho parting mention of Hy in the Irish AnnaIs, and as it
oloses a long list of notiees, running through nearly seven eentmies, it leaves the
island as it found it, in the hands of Irish ecelesiastica an important outpost of the
In'sh Church‚ a centre of union between provinces whose people were of one blood, and
who were enrolled under one name in the list of nations, till the accident of time
limited to one the common name of both, and the accident of place created separate,
and sometimes rival interests.

indicated 111 the old legend referred to st p. 53,

are treated of in pp. 2 58-262. The conjecture ex-
pressed at p. 261, that Colgau had, on his own au-
thority, printed Iona instead of Ioua in the shorter
Latin lives, is confinned by a recent examination of
the Codex Salmanticensis, which the present writer
was enabied to make. It contains the original of
Vita Secunda in Colgan's collection, and invariably
exhibite the name ioua. So that what Abp. Ussher
observes concerning Canisius and Messingham, ⁴¹ ab
Adamnani editoribus passim lova mendose exarata
legitur” (Wks. vol. vi. p. 239) is not borne out.
Theg etymological ordeal that this corrupt word,
Iona, has gone through, certainly has not tended to
reduce it to its original integrity. Forduu, reading
Adamnan's adjective iona as iona, and full 0111115111-
nan’s Scripture equivalent sor Columba (5), imper-
sonates the island, “insula Ῑ. vel Iona Hebraice,
quod Latine Columba'' (261), aud thus introduces
the Hebrew element into Scottish topography. Yet
this appeared very reasonable to Keith (Bps. p. 294,
ed. 1824), and Pennant (Tour, vol. iii. p. 243, ed.
1774)⁷ the former of whom, however, gives a Greek

“Bede caus it Hii, but the proper name is Ῑ, which
in the Gaelic signifies an island.‘’ So far he is
nearly right, but he goes on, ¹⁴ Bede's miseake pro-

the Island of Waves, and 110 adds in the note, “Iona
