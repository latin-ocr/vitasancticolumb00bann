2. St. Mary's Churclz, commonly called the Cathecbral, and in Gaelic, Eaclus Mn.
It is an edificc of the early-'part of the thirteenth century, consisting of nave, transepts,
and choir, with saeristy on north side of choir, and side chapels on the south. The
capitals of some of the columns exhibit bas-reliefs similar to many found in Ireland.
The inscription on the capital of a column under the tower has been already alluded
to. In Graham's Iona are good views of the East and West Fronts (plates 30, 31),
and drawings of the bas-reliefs (plates 40-42). Adjoining the Cathedral, on the north,
are the ruins of the conventual buildings, of which the portion called the chapter-house
is the most ancient and remarkable. Over it is said to have been the libraryk. See
the plato 111 Graham's Iona (No. 38). Near the west entrance, seemjngly beside the
adjacent angle of the cloister, was a small chamber, called St. Columb's Tombk

3. He IVunnery, avenerable pile, much dilapidated, but stffl retaining the evidence
of former elegance. See Muir's lucid description (Eccles. Notes, p. ς). There is no
record of its foundation, and the first writer who mentions it is Fordun (Scotichr. ii. 10).
The Macdonald MS. , apparently borrowing from an earlier authority, states that Beatrix,
only daughter of Sommerled (qui ob. 1164), was prioress of Icollmnkill (Collectan.
p. 287). This indicates the existence of a nunnery in the island circ. 1200.

4. Dempul Bonam, the parish church, first mentioned A. D. 1561, in the Rentalm of
the Bishopric, where is an entry of “the teindis of Ecolmkill callit the personaige of
Tempill-Ronaige.” Its situation is shown by the following references: “ About quarter
of a Milo further South [that 15, of the Reilig Orain] is the Church Ronad, 111 which
several Prior-esses are burieff’ (Martin, p. 262). ‘⁶ The Nunnery Church 15 quite en-
ti.re; one end of it is arched, and is very beautiful. Here also stands, what was called
the parish church. It is yet [A. D. 179 5] entire, but tottering” (Old Stat. Ac. xiv.
p. 202). What is now. considered the parish church is the building, about the size of
Oran’s chapeL on the N. E. of the Numiery, inside its enclosure. The patron saint
was probably the St. Ronan’², commemorated at St. Bonan’s of Ness, in Lewis, and from

¹ Tomb.—This must be a vulgar error. The
saint's grave would hardly be apart from the chief
cemetery (317).

¹¹ Bonam-The Scotch Calendas has two os this
name, one at Feb. 7, of whom Adam King says:
⁴¹8. Ronane bischop in scotland and confess vuder
king malduin& (Cateclu.)7 and who, though 1101110-
ticed in the Calendar of the Brev. Aberd., is men-
tioned in the Propr. SS. of Febr. as “Episcopus
apud Kilmaronen in Livenax“ (Part. Hyem. fol.
54 ba). He, and not Mal-neck, or Conan, (as iu

Orig. Par. vol. i. pp. 34, 503) is the patron saint
of Kilmaronock, 011 the east of Loch Lomond, in
Dumbartonshire. This saint may or may not be
the ‘⁸Ronan, natione quidem Scottus'' of Bcde (H. E.
iii. 2 5), whom the editor of the Orig. Paroch. makes
“a Scotchman” (ii. p. 296), although he had pre-
viously laid down that Scotia was Irelaud (ib. p.
285). Camerarius shows what his own authority is
worth in such questions, sor hc identifies the patron
of Insula Bonan with Bede's Ronau, who was Fi-
nan's polemical opponent, circ. 652, and straight-
way places his death at 778! (Feb. 6, De Scotor.
