⁷ Duin-Foithir.-A gain at 694. Probably Dunot—
tar in Kincardine. Part of the parish of Kilfinan on
Loch Fyne in Cowal, is called Otter, and was a
lordship in 1431, enjoyed by Swene (Suibhne), son
of Ewen. (orig. Par. ii. p. 54) We find “opidum
Fother occisum est a Gentibus” in the Pictish Chron.
circ. 904, which Chalmers understands of Forteviot
(anciently Fothiur- Thabaicht) in Strathearn, the
Pictish capital. Caledon. 1. p. 384. See Dunfoeder
in Sim. Dunelm, Gest. Reg. Augl. An. 934.

³ Mayh-Line.—Now Moylinny, a territory near
the town of Antrim. Rath-more was the seat of the
Dalaradian kings. See Reeves' Eccles. Ant. p. 27 9.

b Dum-Att—Mentioned again nt an. 736. “On
a rocky conica] mount, which rises abruptly out of
Crinan Moss, near the river Ad, is situated the an-
cient fort of Dunad, of an oval form, and measuring
90 feet by 45.'’' (Orig. Paroch. vol. ii. p. 48.)
Dunad is in the parish of Glassary in Argyle, and
lies to the north of the Crinan Canai, from which

it may he seen as the boat approaches the Criuan
Bason. At Kilmahunaigy in North Knapdale, about
afurloug north-west from the banks of the Crinan
Canal, “is a conical eminence 120 γεω-(15 111 circum-
ference at the base, and about 30 feet in height.
This mouud is called Dan Domhnul.'' (N. Stat.
Ac. vol. vii. pt. 2, p. 635.) This district appears
to have been the head-quarters of the house os Gabb-
ran; and somewhere near this we may look for
Duu-Monaidh (201).

⁰ Duin-Duirn.—Girg Mac Dungau, the Scoto-
Pictish king, circ. 897, is said in the Chroniule of
St. Andrew's to have died in Dundurn. which Chal-
mers identifies with Dunadeer, in Aherdeenshire
(Caledon. i. p. 383), avitrified fort-hill now called
Dunnideer, in the pai-ish of Insch. Or the place in
question may be Dumium, at the east end of Loch-
Earn in Perthshire.

people of Scotch οι· Irish Dalriada. The scene of
