ilsemoz'r of St. Adammm. lxi

Of Adamnan’s two Latin works, the tract De Locis Sanctis is the better written
and more flowing, but it bears a striking resemblance to the other in many particulars
of style, and the use of peculial· words and phrases, In the following pagos the reader
will observe the liberal employment of diminutivesffi so characteristic· of Irish composi-
tion ; and he wffl find them, in many cases, used without any grammatieal force, and
eommutab1e‚ in the same chapterS‚ with their primitivos. The same tendeney is also
observable among verbs iu the use of frequentatives and iutensitives. He dclights in
the distributive numerals instead of ἐιη-(11111115, and in the adjective termination (1.1·
where admissible. He uses the pluperfeet for the perfect, and the nominative instead
of the ablative absolute. He occasionally employs Greek& or Greco-Latin words3
and 111 a few instanees introduces Irish and Hibemo-Latin expressions‘. Proper
11311105,Γ he sometimes infleets according to the rules of Irish grammar, so that in a
Latin narrative they present an anomalous appetu-anee- Above an, the artifieial, and
often unnatural, interweaving of his words, in long sentences, and the oft-remuring
ablative absolute in awkward position, will strike the reader as remarkable features
of the style.

One subject more remains to be considered: the veneration of St. Adamnau's me-
mory. In testimony of this, two classes of monuments exist, namely, the ehurehes
under his patronage, and the appellations commemorative of his name.
