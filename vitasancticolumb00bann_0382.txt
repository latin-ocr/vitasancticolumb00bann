3. KuLs.——The Irish name is Cenonnup, which signifies ¹ Head-abode‚’ and gives
the title of Ileadfort in the hish, and Keulis in the British Peerage, to the family of
Taylor, whose seat is beside the town of Kells. Ix'enlis is the transition form of the
name. The site of the monastery was anciently known as Dan-chuile-sibrinnep, and
the suirounding territory was called Mayh-Sez'riylffl. It is situate in the north-west
of the eounty of Meath, and gives name to a pai-ish. The old Irish Life, followed by
O'Donnell, states that in St. Columba's time it was the royal dun or seat of Diarmait
Mac Cerbhaill, and adds: ‘¹ Colum-cille then marked out the city in extent as it now
is, and blessed it all, and said that it would become the most illustrious possession he
should have in the land, although it would not be there his resurrection should be.”
O'Donnellr observes that Diarmait granted it to the saint in amends for injuries which
he had done to him, and that his 5011 Aedh Slane was a consenting party. If a church
was founded licre by St. Columba, it must have been an ineonsiderable one, for there
is no mention of the place in the Annals as a religious seat until 804, when, on account
of the dangers and sufferings to which the community of Hy were exposed, measures
were taken for the provision of an asylum in Ireland; and, as the Annals of Ulster
state, Cohoipc Ceanonnpo cen chae Do Choluim chille 00010011 hoe ormo, ‘ Kells

time forwasd it became the chief scat of the Columbian monks. There are several in-
dications of the ancient importanoe of the place 51111 remaining, such as the fine Round
Towcr³, about ninety feet high, which stands 111 1110 ehurohyard; the curious oratory
called ‘ st. Columkille's House3’ the ancient cross in the churehyard, having on the
phuth the inscription, caux poemen ec commo& a second mss, now
standing near the market-plaee3 and a third, once the finest, now lying in a muti-
latcd condition 111 the ehurehyard. The shafts of all these 0105505 were covered with
historical representat-lons from Scripturc. Trinity College, Dublin, possesses its great
literas-y monument commonly known as the ⁴ Book of Kells.’ It is an Evangeliarium
somcwhat resembling the Book of Durrow, but far surpassing it in the brilliancy and
elaborateness of its execution. See note M, infra. In the tenth and following eenturies
