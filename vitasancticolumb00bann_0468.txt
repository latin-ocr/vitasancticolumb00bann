36 2 A dditional N otes. [x.

The Bamz, called poholt in the Irish Life, was an out-office of considerable import-
ance (230). Here the grain, when sequestram (230) or winnowed, was
stored in heaps (z'b.). We may prcsume that it was situate near the kiln
and the mffl.
The Kiln was employed both for the trituratio fraqam (56), and ad spicae siccan-
das (88 n). The latter process was conducted in a large sieve, rota de
rii-qis conferta (ib.). This building stood nem· the path which led from
the monastery to the landing- place (87).
Adanman does not mention the Mill‘, but he speaks of the baker, and of bread. A
stream, which flows easrwards, a little to the north of the monastery, is still called
Srutlc-a-oenhuz‘lz'nn, or ‘ Min-stream? It rises in a bog called the Lochan
Molendinum» mor, or ⁴ Great Lakelet, which may hare served as a lirin ιη mustum, or
⁴mffl-p0nd'b. The stream is small now, because the Lochan is nearly
‹lmined; but there are no traces of a weir, and the wheel of the mill was possibly a

that he commenced the Altus ; and it was simul-

See p. 330, supra. St. Fechin, who flom-ished in
the interval between Columcille and Adamnan,
erected a water-mill near his abbey of Fore, which
is mentioned in his Life, cap. 14 (Colg. Aet. SS.
p. 131 b), and spoken of by Giraldus Cambreusis
