And this misapprehension appears, even at a recent date, in the Fasti Ecclesiae Hiber-
nicae, where the learned compiler observes of the first bishop of Raphoe, ‘⁴ St. Eunan
is commonly reported to have erected ‘the abbey church of Raphoe into a cathedral, and
to have been its first bish0p; but nothing certain appears to be known of him, nor of
the time at which he lived⁷’¹. What is more remarkable, St. Eunan's day has been
observcd on the 7th of September, while St. Adamnan‘s was kept 011 the 231·d. Bat-
tersby‘s Catholio Directory for 1855 represents St. Eunan, the patron saint of Raphoey
as a Bishopm, but of the famous individual called by Ven. Bede Adamnan presbytera,
ὖυδεὶς λᾰνγος. Such an error should not have been committed in the century, one of
the ornaments of which had said: ‘⁴ I strongly suspect that St. Etman, who is usually
called the first bishop of Raphoe, was no other than Adamnan”⁰.

Scottish writers are less in error. The Breviary of Aberdcen eorrectly places
S. Adampnanus, Abbas, at Sept. ²3¹³3 Adam King and Dempster commemorate St.
'rhewnanae who is represented as preceptor of King Eugenius VI.y at Sept. ²3; and
Keith, in like manner, only that he represents the saint by the name of Thennaw.
The Seotch Prayer Book of 1638, in its Calendar, borrows the Irish error of making
him a bish0p‚ and places his day at Sept. 25. But T. Innes was awarc of these inac-
euracies, and spoke of Adamnan as ‘⁸' called by ‘the vulgar S. Deunan οι· Thcuna11‘'⁵.

Among English writers, Alban Butlert repeats Sir J ames Ware's mistakes; while
Sir Han-is Nicholas, gathoring up the blunders of Ireland and Seotlandy makes a tri-
partite division of Adamnan's sanctity, and sets out in his Citle11(lar¹¹——

Etman. Bishop of Raphoe, ...... at Sept. 73
Adamnan, Abbot, ......... ut Sept. z3; and
Thennan, Abbot and Confessor, . . . . . at Sept. z 3.

The vario‘cy of the name in early reem-ds consists only in ‘the differe-nce ofAdamnan
and Adomnan. Cod. A„ in the four places where the word occurs, reads Adomnanusw
(¹0d. B. reads „adamnanus once'*‘, and Aclomnanas twiec¹; Codd. C. F. S. vary in like
111anner; Cod. D. always reads Adamnanzcs. The title of the tract De Locis Sam-tis!
