A ppend ix to Preface.

On the death of Failbhe, in 679, Adamnan was elected to the abbacy of Hy, being
now fifty-five years of age. Bruide, 5011 of Bile, the most valiant of the Pictish kings
since the reign of his namesake, the son of Macleon, preceded the abbot. 111 1115 eleva-
tion but one year, so that Adamnan's ineumbcncy is set down 111 the Chronicle of the
Scottish Kings⁰ as the ecclesiastical parallel of his reignd. Aldfrid‚ the Northumbrian
prinec, whom the Irish knew as Flann F inae, iiras now an exile in Ira-land& Thither
11(Ι had probably boen led through his mother's alleged connexion With the chief family
of 1118 north, and here probably it had been that Adamnan commenced that intimacy
which caused the Irish to call Aldfi-id the alumnus of Adamnang, and which proved so

·¹ His reiqn.—The Irish Life of St. Adamnan tells
the following θυι-10115 storyof this king's intermeat:
¹⁴ The body of Bruide, son of Bile, king os the
Cruthnigh, was brought to 13, and his death was
sorrnwrul and grievous to Adamnan, and he de-
six-ed that the body os Bruide should be brought to
hini into the house that night. Adamnan watched
by the body till morning. Next day, when the
body began to move and open its eyeS‚ a certain
pious 111311 came to the door of the house, and said,
If Adnmnau's object be to raise the dead, 1 say he
should not do 50, for it will be a degradation to every
cleric who shall succeed to 1115 place, if he too 0311-

1101 raise the dead. There is somewhat of right in .

11131, replied Adamnan. Therefore, as it is more
proper, let 115 give our blessing to the body and to
the 50111 of Bruide. Then Bruide resigned his spirit
to heaven again, with the blessing of Adamnan and
1118 congregation os la. Then Adamnau said—

ἲ Ireland.—Notwithstanding all Thomas lunes's
penetration and candour, he was unable 10 shake off
entirely the old natioual infatuation about scotia.

See the passage cited at p. 186, infra. And again:
“ The names Scotia and Hibernia, which in 111858
1111185 were indifferently applied, by the writers, to
Ireland and Scotland‚'' and, ‘¹ 1115 adding in Hibernia
is the effect of the confusion of this name, applied
sometimes, as I said, 111 ancient times, αι wel!
to the northern part ⁰f Baitain, inlmbieed by the
Scots, aa to laland, properly so called ” (Civ. Ech
Hist. pp. 292, 293). Goodall says that Ireland was
not known till after Vespasian's time, and that the
Ιὲρνη of Strabo lies north of th'e Forthl—Introd.
to Fordun. cap. z (vol. i. p. 3). But see how Pin-
kerton despatches such nonsense (Enquiry, vol. i.
p. 7); und his observations on the attempt to place
Eriu in strath-Erne (ihr vol. ii. p. 225).
