s &mmmmm—stated in the passage cited
in last note from St. Fechin's Life to have
been in Carbre Gablzra. To which may be
added the following, from the Life of St.
Ruadhan of Lorrha: ‘¹ Quadam autem die cum
venisset Rodanus ad civitatem quae dicitur
Suam-Lnthir‚ in regione Generis Karbri, in
eadem 'nora rex Generis Karbri mortuus fere-
batur in curru ad civitatem illam, totaque
plebs circa illum valde lugens erat. Tune
Rodanus illis misertus oravit Dominum. et
statim rex surrexit vivus, et obtulit civitatem
illam Suam-Luthir et gentem sibi adhaerentem
sancto Rodano.'' (Act. SS. April. ii. p. 383 α.)
Colgan thought that this Caii-bre Gabhra was
the same as Cairbre of Drumcliff, now the ba-
rony of Carbury, in the county of Shgo, and
accordingly takes Snamh-luthir to that re-
mote part of Connaught, but, as might be ex-
pected, is unable to fix its position. (Tr. Th.
p, 384b‚ n. 35; Act. SS. p. 141b‚ n. 18) Col-
gan's authority led Archdall to place Snamh-
luthir iu the county of Sligo: and, as a conse-

quence, to confeSS, ⁴· we know nothing further

of this abbey.¹' (Monast. p. ⁶39·) But Dr.
O‘Donovan was not to be so easily misled, sor
he shows that Cairbre Gabhra is represented
hythe modern barony of Granard, in the N. E.
of the county of Longford. (Four Mast. 731.)
That the territory, however, extended much
further northwards, and included a considera-
ble portion of Loughtee Upper, in the count)-
of Cavan, will appear from the identification of
Snamh-luthair. We are brought still nearer on
our way by the ecclesiastiea] Inquisition taken
at Cavan, in 1609, in which we read: ¹* And the
said jurors doe further uppon meir oathes, say
aud present, that in the said barony of Loughty
