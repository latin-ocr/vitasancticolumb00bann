farm were not required to attend during the day¹² (71), and fatigue after
their labour would probably demand unbroken sleep at night. The congregation was
summoned to the oratory siqno personante (170, 213), that is, by the sound of the bell
(33, 2 34), both on stated and extraordinary occasions. Being assembled, they pro-
ceedcd to the oratory, sometimes in attendance on the abbot (211), sometimes with less
regularity (34, 234). At night they carried lanterns with them (235).

Tho (lies solennes were the (lies Domz‘nz'cce, and Sanctorum natales (181, 182, 210),
which were solemnized in the same manner, by rest from labour, the eelebration of the
Eucharist, and the use of better food (1 1 1). The festival commenced after ‘the sunset of
the preceding day (181, 210, 230, 310), and its stated services were the Verpertinalis
missa (112, 191, 2 33), Matutz'm' (2 34), Primo (209), Tierce, Sext (181), and probably
A'rme (90, 121, 156). The chief service, missarum solemma (77, 210, 221), was some-
times at Prime (209), or at Sext (181) : on such an occasion the cantores (21 1 ) chantcd

Τ he chapter of the Rule of Columbams, De Cursu,
prescribes: “Per diurnas terni PsaJmi horas pro
operum interpositione statuti sunt a Senioribus nos-
tris cum versiculorum augmento intervenientium
pro peccatis primum nostris, deinde pro omni po-
pulo Christiane, deinde pro Sacerdotibus, et reliquis
Deo consecratis sacrae plebis gradibus, postremo pro
eleemosynas facientibus, postea pro pace regum, no-
vissime pro iuimicis.''—Cap. 7 (Flem. Coll. p. 6 α).
The corresponding order of special intercessions in
the Antiphonarium Benchorense ie as follows: 1.
Oratio communis Fratrum, beginning “Ne merni-
neris iniquitatum nostrarum.'' 2. Pro Baptizatis.
3. Pro Abbate. 4. Pro Fraternitate. 5. Pro Pace
populorum et requiri. 5. Pro Blasphemantibus.
6. Pro Impiis. 7. Pro Iter facientibus. 8. Pro
Eleemosinariis. 9. Pro Infirmis. This serves as
an interesting conuneutary 011 the Rule3 and, eou-

pupil of St. Comgan at Bangor, we can understand
the reference in Senioribus nostris. Possibly Qffi-
cinlis Liber would be a more suitable name than
Antiphonarium ; it is the title found in a St. Gau
manuscript (Maskeit Mon. Rit. Eccl. Angl. vol. i.
p. xxxiv.); and tlie two classes of Irish service
books were Libri Officiales et Missales (Vit. S.
Muunae, 0. 12, Cod. Marsh. 128 αα).
