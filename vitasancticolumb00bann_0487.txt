XII.—F.u:1.cn. Sed. 717-724. Ob. April 3.

Son of Dorbene, of the raee of Conall Guiban, but in a different line from the preceding
abbots, nameiy. through his son Nathi. He was born in 642, for he was 74 years old when he
was elected to the cathedra Colambe in 716, and he was 82 years of age when he died. Under
him, accordjug to Tighernadi, the society of Hy received the coronal tonsure. There is some
uneertainty about his festival: Colgan places it at April 3, but the name does not appear in the
Calendars at that day. They have Faoichu, without any place, at May 23, and July 20. It
was pmbabRy soon after 1115 accession that the Columbina congregation was driven by king
Nechtan beyond the Pictish frontier. They were, no doubt, reluctant to acquiesce in the royal
edict, ‘¹ Hoc observare tempus paschae cum universa nien. gente perpetuo volo; hanc accipere
debere tonsuram quam plenam esse rationis audimus, omnes qui in meo regno sunt clerioos
decerno.''—(Bede‚ Η. Ε. ν. 21.) See note Ρ, p. 184, supra.

¹² Sabbati.—-Oct. 28 is g, therefore, being Satur-
day, Sunday is A, the Dum. Letter of 713.

⁰ ome.-Osred‚ king of the Northumbiiaus, was
siaiu, according to the Saxon Chron.‚ in 716, on
“the southern border.'' Bede fixes the reformation
of the Columbian monks at the year “quo Osredo
omis& (Η, E. v. 22, 24).

p Sabbati.—Aug. 29 is c, therefore, being Satur-
day, Sunday is D, indicaring 716.

¹1 munim-The parish of Manner in Peebles was

called Maineure in 1 186, and Menewire 111 1 256.—
(Orig. Par. vol. i. p. 238.)

¹ Finylinue.--There is a Finglen in Campsie in
Stirlingshire3 but the place in question seems to
have been in Argyle, in the territory os Lorn.

ὅ Quinteseria—This, though iu Tigh. also, is an
error, for Thurs. Sep. 13 is 11, and indicates G as
the Sunday Lettery instead of A. The substitution
of quarte or vii. Id. will remove the difficulty. The
Dublin copy reads vi. Id.
