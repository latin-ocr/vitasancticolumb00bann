with the experienee, the feeling, and the piety, which characterize his Life of
St. Columba, the voice of Christendom would have borrowed the word from
his eountrymanW‚ and irreversibly have coupled his name with the title of
Admirable. Even in the limitet] sphere which he chose, he soon acquired, to
use a modern expression, a European celebrity‚ and the numerous copies of his
writings which are found scattered over the Continentx show in what esteem
he was held abroad. lt was therefore more rhetorical than just in a late his-
toriany of the English Church, to create a silent sister beside the vocal Lindis-
farne, and state that ‘⁶ splendid as is the fame of Iona, the names of almost all
its literary men have perished.'' Sui-ely Adamnan and Cummene are more than
names, and if names be wanting, the Chronicle of Hyz is not so barren as to
suggest the old lament—

“ Omnes illacrymabiles
Urgentur, ignotique longa
Nocte.”

Adamnan’s Life of St. Columba has obtained due publicity in print, yet
has always appeared in such a form as to render it more a subject of research
than of ordinary study. It was first printed by⁴Henry Canisius³‚ vin the fifth
volume of his Antiquae Lectiones, on the authority of a manuscript preserved in
the monastery of &Vindberg in Bavaria. Twenty years afterwards, Thomas
Messinghamb, an Irish priest‚ reprinted the tract from Canisius, in his florileg)-
