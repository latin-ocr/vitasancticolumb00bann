23. Compare Bede, H. E. iv. 23. The Irish
word is cloec or 0105, akin to the English
cloch. Some ecelesiastica} bolls as old as the
time ol* St. Columba. are preserved in lreland.
They are formed of sheet iron, bent into a
sour-sided form, like the modern bulloek-bells
of Spain, and the sheep-bells of Wihshire,
fastened with rivets, and brazed. One of the
most original passages in the legends of the
Breviary of Aberdeen occurs in the office of
St. Lughaidh or Moluoc, an Irisbmau, the
founder of the Scotch Lismore, who died in
592 : ⁴ss Sed et die quadam cumserream campa-
nam et quadratam sue ecclesie pernecessariam
fabricandam haberet.⁷’—Proprium SS. Part..
Estiv. fol. 6 ιια. The quadrangular bell of
St. Gall, the Irish missionary to Switzerland,
who died circ. 646, is preserved in the monas-
tery of the city which bears his name, but per-
verted from its original design by beingattached
to a wall, for all the ancient Irish bells were
hand-bells. Though the accommodatiori of
such bclls was only one of the purposes for
which the Round Towers servcd, yet they pro-
cur-ed sor those peculiar structures the name of
Cimo-Ceae, 01· Δ bell-house! For drawings of

Miathi as his allies; and whether the term
barbari, which follows, is applicable to the lat-
ter, or to a common foe. Cummineus, however,
from whom the substance of the anecdote is
copied, expressly says, “pro Aidano et populo
ejus.’'—cap. 25. (Act. SS. Bened. Ord. i. p.

next chap. and i. 49, iii. 5.

ἕ Bellum.-—Fordun copies this chapter almost
verbatim, and identifies the subject of it with
the battle of Wodenysburgh, which was fought,
according to the Saxon Chronicle, in 59¹- He
places it near Chester, whither Aedan marched
to the support of Cadwalla, the British king.
(Scotichr. iii. 29.) But such a supposition is
inadmissible, if the identity of the Miathi and
Maeatae be allowed. Ussher proposes ⁴* the
battle of Lethrigh by Aedan the son of Gabb-
ran,'' which Tighernaeh records at 590, and
Ann. Ult. at 589; and subsequent writers adopt.
the suggestion, especially Chalmers, who makes
it history, and, on his own authority, fills up
the blanks: ‘⁴ In fighting, again, in support of
the Britons, he defeated the Saxons, in 590, at
the battle of Leithredh, when his two sons,
Arthur, and Eocha-fin, were, however, slain,
with rather more than three-hundred men.''
