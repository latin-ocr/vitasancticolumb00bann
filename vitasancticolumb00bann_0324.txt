ὓ Comqellus Mocu Aridi.——In the Antipho-
nary of Bangor (circ. 690) his name is written
Comqillus‚- in his Life, Comyallus. In the early
Calendars and Annals it is always written
Commu. The meaning assigned by some is
pulchrum pignus (Flem. Collect. pp. 302 b,
304 ὁ, marg.; Aet. SS. Mai. tom. ii. p. 580),
but there is the highest authority for a differ-
ent interpretation. St. Columbanus, his dis-
ciple, in his Instructio ii. thus writes: “Non
primum nostrae parvitatis fundamenta jacere
praesumimus, alicujus majoris doctoris autho-
ritatem quaerentes, sancti scilieet Fausti lucu-
lentissimam, elegantissimamque doctrinam, de
cujus dictis pauca ad initiandum opus nostrum
satis convenienter elegimus.¹’ (Flem. Collect.
p. 47 a.) So also Notker Balbulus: “Cum plur-
imos discipulos, vel socios sanctitatis suae pares
habuisset, unum tamen Congellum, latineFausti
nomine illustrem, praeceptorem B. Columbani,
magistri domini et patris nostri Galli.''—Mar-
tyrol. Jun. 9. Comgall was born in Mourne,
now Magheramorne, a district ou the coast of
the county of Antrim, a little south of Larne.
(Reevcs, Eccl. Ant. p. 269.) His father-’s name
was sema, and his mother's Brig, and they be-
longed to the kingdom of Dal-Araidhe, or Dal-
nary as the Life calls it. which comprehended the
southern hals of the county of Antrim. (Flem.
Collect, p. 303 a.) The tribe name given to
Comgall in the text is mne u (lumbe, filius
nepotum Amida} he being fourteenth in descent
from Fiacha Araidhe (cire. 220), the ancestor
of the Dal-Araidhe‚ whose territory was com-
monly called Dalaradia. See Reeves‚ Eccl.
Antiqq. pp. 334-342. Comgall, according to
Tighernaeh. was born in 517 (An. Ult. 516);

cient Bobio manuscript (Anecdota Ambros. vol.
iv. p. pp. 127—159; reprinted in his Opere, tom.

alphabetical hymn on St. Comgall. See i. 49

Ε Cainnechus Moru Dalon.—See i. 4 (p. 28),
ii. ¹3 (p. 121)¹ 14 (p. 123), supra. He was akin
to St. Comghall, being a descendant of Rudh—
raighe Mor, of the race of lr, king of Ireland.
but of a totally different stoek from St. Co-
lumba. The family he belonged to was the
corea-Dauum, a branch of the Clanna Rudh-
raighe (Ogyg. p. 275 ; 1r. Nennius, p. 264), and
from Dalan, his great-grandfather, he derived
the surname mue-un-Onlunn, filius nepotis
Dallani, mentioned in the text. and other
authorities. (An. Inissall. 595 ; Bat. of Magh
Rath, p. 26.) In the Feilire of AEnguS, at his
