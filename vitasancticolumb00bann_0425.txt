3. Tm: Comae-coeam is the Irish form of cuculla, a word which occurs in the
text at p. 136, supra, where there is evidence to show that, even so early as Adamnan‘s
time, the gar-ment expressed by it was supposed to have been eudowed with super-

Aedh Slaine, proceeds to say:

Suibhne‚ son of Colman. At the end of
four years he went 011 an expedition. Hc
forgot his cowl. He was slain that day.

The legend in the Book of Lecau, cited at p. 39, supra, represents Aedh, son of
Aimm're, as the recipient of the favour. O'Donneu copies both statements, and exhibits
the two Aedhs as provided respectively with charmed vest-ments&

The old English version, suppressing the first syllable of the word in question, and
