Itinerar. Cambr. ii. 1.) The first appearance of
this disease in Ireland is stated by Tigheruach
to have been in the year 550; and in Britain,
by the Annales Cambriae2 at 547. However,
isthe Life of St. Declan bc entitled to credit, it
was previously experieneed iu the former king-
dom; for it is related that in the lisetime of
that saint, “dira pestis venit in Momoniam;
sed venenosior erat in civitate Casseh quam in
ceteris locis; quae flavos primitus faciebat ho—
minos, et postea occidebas (Act. SS. Jul.
tom. v. p. 602 b.) The second recorded visita-
tion of the island by the disease was the most
severe, when, during the abbotship of Cuimine
Ailbe, in the year 664Ἰ Adamnan being then forty
years ofage, as Bede relates, “ subita pestilen-
tiae lues, depopulatis prius australibus Brittaniae
plagis, Nordanhymbrorum quoque provinciam
corripiens, atque acerba clade diutius longe
lateque desaeviens, magnam hominum multi-
tudinem stravit. Haec autem plaga Hiberniam
quoque insulam pari clade premebat.” (H. Ε.
iii. 27.) Tighernach rccords its appearance
in 664 in these words: Tenehroe [i. e. Eclipsis
solis] in Calendis *Maii in hora nona, et in eadem
estate celum ardere visum est. Mortalicas ηιαφιιι
in Hiberniam pen-enit in Calendis Auyusti, i. e.
in Maylz Itha in Laqem'a. Et terroe motus in
Britannia. In campo Itlz in Foclzairt exarsit
mortalitas primo in Hibernia, a morte Patricii
These computa-
tions, it is to be observed, go back to the death
of Seu-Patrick. Under the following year, the
Annalist adds: Abbatesque Reyesque innumera-
biles mortui fixerant. With him agree the no-
tices in the An⁴ Ut. at 663, 664, 666, in which

the continued prevalence of the mortality is
recorded. At 667, it was stin raging, for they
have the entry‚ Mortalicas nzaqua Buidlie Co-
naill. After this the disease appears to have
abated for a time ; but it soon after broke out
with renen-ed violence. The Annals of luis-
falleu, at 67 ι, which is 683 of the common era,
notice the Initium tertiae mortalitatis,· and the
Ann. Cambr. (683) record ‘⁴ Mortalitasin Hiber-
nia,'' with which agrees the Brut y Tywysogion
at the same date3 while at 682 they tell us,
“Mox-talitas magna fnit in Britannia. in qua
Catgualart filius Catguolaum obiitff‘ (Menum.
Hist. Brit. pp. 833, 841.) The Ann. Ult„ at
632, have, Initium mortalitatis puerorum in
mense Octobris; and again, in the following
year, Mortalitas parvulorum. The Four Mast.
at 684 record, ‘¹ A mortality upon all auimals
in general, throughout the whole world, for
the space of three years, so that there eseaped
not one out of the thousand of any kind of ani-
mals.” Which Florence of Worcester, at 685,
describes as “Magna pestilentiae procella, Bri-
tanniam corripiens, lata nece vastavit.'’ (Mo-
num. p. 537.) The existence of the scourge in
England at 680 may be gathered from Bede
(H. E. iv. 7, 14); and at 686, from his Historia
Abh. Wiremuth (e. 8). From the date of its
appearance in 664, to the commencement os
the following century, the Irish Annals record
a continued train of portents and calamities;
thus affording evidence of the sufferings and
terrors experienced during this period.
