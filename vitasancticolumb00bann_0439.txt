pline varied in intensity with the tcmpers or ascet-ic habits of the framersb. They
agreed, however, in their preference of ‘the presbyterate5 their observance of the old—
fashioned Eastcr ς the anterior Eastern tonsure; and seclusion from female society. It
is a remarkable fact that many of thc monastic churches, which grew in after times to
bc bishops’ sees, were founded by prcsbytcrs ; Clonard, by Finnian; Clonmacnois, by
Cinam Clonfert, by Brendan3 Aghabo, by Cainnech3 Glendaloch, by Κρήτη Lis-
more, by Carthaeh3 and Derry, Raphoe‚ and Hy, by Columba. The great promoters
of the conventual system sought no hig-her order than such as would enable thom, con-
sistently with the vows of humility, to administer the sacrambnts, and conduct the
ordinary devotions of their fraternities. The abbatial office gave them all the juris-
diction of the episcopate, without its rcsponsibilities ; and little more was left to the
bishop than the essenee of his office, the transmission of holy orders, with tho pcrsonal
reverence which was due to the holder of so important a commission. Another clement
in the In'sh monastic system was its socia] connexions. Evcry great monastery was a
uentre of family relation, and served as a school or asylum for au who were of patron’s
or founder’s kin. This particular was most strikingly exemplified in the casc of Hy,
as may be seon in the genealogica] table of the early abbots annexcd to this note, which
shows that the abbaey was, with one or two exceptions, stlictly limitcd to a brnnch of
the Tir-Conallian family. It shows, also, that there was no linea] sueocssion in Hy,
as there was in many other Irish monasteries, where seeular inte-rests so fin* prevailcd
as to make the abbacy hereditaryc, and ultimately to frustrate the founder's intention

b hamera—The persona] austerities which are
attributed to some of the Irish saints are almost in-
credible. The Life of Comgau relatas that that
saint, having retired to custodiaria Insula (called
in the Calendar 1111Γ Οοιῐὶιεεσεα, now Ely Island)
in Lough Erue, “monachi sui post eum in illam in-
sulam intraverunt; et non valentes rigidissime vi-
vere, sicut suus Abbas, septem ex eis fame et frigore
mortui sunt.'’-—-cap. 12 (Flem. Collect. p. 305 α).
The Life of St. Caiunech represents him as travelling
‘⁴ trans Dorsum Britannioe,” and states that ‘⁴ Sancti
Hybernienses miserunt nuncios post Sanctum Cain-
uicum audientes eum heremitam esse in Britannia, et
tunc ductus est sanctus Cainnicus de heremo contra
suam voluntatem'¹ (Vita, pp. 13, 39, ed. Ormonde).

gan's Acta Sanctori Adamnan records one instance
of St. Columba's mortification (p. 233, snpra).

Ε Hereditary.—The Book of Annagh gives us a
most valuable insight into the ancient economy of
the Irish monasteries in its account of the endow-
ment of Trim. In that church there was an Eccle—
siastica proyenies and a Flebilis proqenim, a reli-
gious and secular snccession: the former, of office,
in spirituals; the latter, of blood, in tempora1s3
aud both ‹lescended from the original grantor. In
the religious succession eight names are mentioned,
and it is added, “Hi omnes episcopi fuerunt et
principes* [abbots]; in the lineal succession there
are nine names in a descending pedigree, and it was
from this line that the ecclesiastica proyenies was
from time t‘o time supplied (fol. 16 bb). The lineal
transmission of the abbatial office, which appears in
the Irish Annals towards the close of the eighth
century, probably had its origin in the usurpation
by the plebilis proyenies connected with the various
monasteries of the functions of the ecclesiastica pro-
9enies, which would be the necessary result of the
