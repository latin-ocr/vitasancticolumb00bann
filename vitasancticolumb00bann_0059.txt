this Life, that it was Manus, the son of Hugh, son of Hugh Roe, sou of Niall

Life which was in Latin to be put into Gaelie; and who ordered the part that
was in difficult Gaelic to be modificd, so that it might be clear and eompre-
hensible to every one; and who gathered and put together the parts of it that
were scattered through the old books of Erin3 and who (lictated it out of his
own mouth, with great labour, and a great expenditure os time in studying
how he should arrange all its parts in their proper places, as they are left here
in writing by us3 and in love and friendship for his illustrious saint, Relative‘,
and Patron, to whom he was devoutly attached. It was in the castle ofPort-
na—tri-naxnad' that this Life was indited, when were fulfilled 12 yearS, and 20,
and 500, and 1000 of the age of the Lordv”.
