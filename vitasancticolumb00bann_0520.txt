Adamnan sretzchouoe insulae (54, conf. 28, 55, 61, 82), 111 after times named the Bay
of Finfhrffi, and now commonly known as the Sound of Iona. The island lies N. E.
and S. W„ is about three miles long, and varies in breadth from a mile to a mile and
a half. The earliest reference to its extent is in Bede‚ who, according to the vague
mode of calculation current in his day, says: “Neque enim magna est, sed quasi
familiai-unffi quinque, juxta aestimationem Anglorum’' (H. E. iii. 4); that is, v. hymn,
¹ five hides of land,' as his Saxon interpreter, and the Saxon Chronicle (An. 56 5), ex-
press it. Fordun (Seotichr. 11.1), and 0111015Θ after him, represent the length as two
miles. The superficie] extent is estimateds at 2000 imperial acreS, 600 of which are
under cultivation, and the remainder, 11111 pasture, morass, and rocks. The surface is
very unci-en, and for the most vpart consiste of small green patches, altcrnating with
rocky p1·ojccti0nS‚ which in thc northern half of the island are more high and craggy,
being intersected with deep ravines, but in the southern half, where the general level
is higher, are more continens, and present to the eye an undulating expense of a gray,
barren waste. The object which first marks the island in the distance is Dunii, its
highest ground, a round hill, in the northern part, which has an elevation of 330 feet.
There are several other eminenccs, but none of them attain to 200 feet. The popula-
tione, between the years 1782 and 1842, increased from 277 to 500; but the eonse-

story (Anderson‘s Guide, p. 592, ed. 1850), a rather
formidable introduction, however, in squally wea-
ther. The author uf the Antiquities of Iona, proba-
bly wishing to find a counterpart to the Norse Eyna
Helqo, suggests ‘Ii-show, ¹ Holy Island' (but rom]
is happy) as the most likely origin of Iona. In this
he is followed by the writer of “Staffa and Iona De-
scribed‚” who dismisses I-thon ‘¹ as an inappropriate
epithet, expressive of no distinctiva character, inas-
much as it will be difficult to point out au island in
the ocean, which is not an island of waves''! (p. 60,
ed. Blackie ἃ. Son). The true etymological story
is told by Archdeacon Monro, in 1594, in these few
words: ⁴‘ The ile Erisehe canit I-colm-kill, that is,
Sanct Colm‘s ile'’ (Miscell. Scot. vol. iL p. 127).

¹’ Bruma—T. Iunes makes the channel two miles
broad, and concludes “that the distance betwixt
these two islands was not so great iu S. Columba's
time, since wc find that passengers used to call over
the frith from Mull to Ycolmkill'’ (Civ. Eccl. Hist„
p. 162). But see note at p. 54, supra. 1111105 pro-
bably took his distance from Monro's “Nan-est this,

Finfort is the name of the lauding-place opposite
Port Rouain, on the Mul] side. Here is an ancient
burying-ground, but without any old tombstones.
It was probably, in the first instance, a cot-pach, or
testing-place, in foul weather, for bodies on their
way to Hy. Archdu. Monro mentions “a guid
raid ἔοι-110111 Colmkill, canit Pollaisse,'' but the
name is now unknown.
