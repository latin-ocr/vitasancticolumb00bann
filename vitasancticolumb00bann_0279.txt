CAP. 44.] ¹75

in Levitico librob transgressoribus coaptata populis comminatio videretur innui-
nere, qua dicit, Dabo coelum vobis desuper sicut ferrum, et terram aeneam.
Consumetur ineassum labor vestem nec proferet terra germen, nec arbores
poma praebebunt3 et eaetem. Nos itaque haec legentes, et imminentem plagam
pertimescentes, hoc inito consilio fieri consiliati sumus, ut aliqui ex nostris
senioribus nuper aratum et seminatum⁰ campum cum sancti Colnmbae candida
circumirent tunicad, et libris stylo ipsius descriptis3 levarentque iu aere, et
excuterent eandem per ter tunicam, qua etiam hora exitus ejus de carne indutus
erat3 et ejus aperirent libros, et legerent in Colliculo Angelorunf, ubi ali-
quando coelestis patriae cives ad beati viri condictum visi sunt· descendere.
Quae postquam omnia juxta initum sunt peracta consilium, mirum dictu, eadem
die coelu1n‚ in praeteritis mensibus, Martio videlicet et Aprili, nudatum nubi-
bus, mira sub celeritate ipsis de ponto ascendentibus illico opertum est, et

But. St.. Aidus performed a greater wonder
than either: “Pei-gens ad castra Mumonien-
sium, rota currus sui, in via plana fracta est,
et currus altera rota sine impedimento curre-

Vit. c. 7 (Colg. Act. SS. p. 419 α).

¹· Scripsisse sufficiat.—Here the codd. of the
shut-ter recension terminate the second book.
with the observation: ‘⁵ animadvertere Lector
«lebet, quod etde compertis in eo multa propter
legentium prmtermissa suut fastidiumff·

iDe carne transitum-Some of his posthu-
mous powers have been related in i. i (pp. ¹3·
17) supra.

³ Annos quatuorderim—The drought liure
mentioned was probably partini: had it boen
generally felt in boland, the likelihood is that
it would have been recorded in the Annals, and
thus means have been afforded of calculating
cxactly the date os Adamnan's writing. Tigh-
ernach at 714, and the Annals of Ulster at 7¹3·
record a siccitas mayna, but this cannot refer
to the visitation mentioned in thc text, for
Adamnan died in 704. The substance of this
chapter is briei-ly related in Cummian's Life,
where it is prefaced, k· Post mortem viri Dei.''
Now ifthis bc a genuine work, and ifthe writer
be Cuimine Ailbe, it will follow that the pre-svnt

chapter os Adamnan was written between 679
and 683 z for Cummian, who relatos the oecur-
rence, died in 669, therefore that is the latest
date to which we can add the 14 years in the
text, which brings us to 683, four years after
Adamnan's clevation to the abbacy of Hy*

t Levitico libru.—Chap. xxvi. 19, 20. The
reading in the text agrees exactly with that iu
the vulgate.

‘' Se11zim1eum.—]t appears in the sequel that
this had becn done at the end of April or be-
ginning of May, so that we may conclud⁰ that
agricultural opcrations were conducted in that
age at an earlier time of the year than thoy
now are. see chap. 3 (p. 107) supra.

ό Candida tunica—'rius was his inner gar-
ment. The garments which thc rule of St.
Benedict prescribed for monks in moderate
climates were the Tunica and Cucullum-Cap.

plzibalus in i. 3 (p. 25), cap. 6 (p. 113), auu!
cuculla, cap. 24 (p. 136), supra. Ou one occa-
sion St. Mar-tin took off his tunica for a poor
man, and proeeeded ‘⁸ extrinsecus indutus ani-
