anciently Doire-Effine, and now Kilmacrenan,
a parish in the county of DonegaL which gives
name to a barony that was originally known as
the territory of CmeL Luissoeoo nuc Secno,
‘ Tribe of Lughaidh, son of Setna,' or Siot
Seruo. ‘Raoe of Setna7’ being so called from
Setna, brother of Fedhlimidh, St. Columba's
father. The churcbes connected with the his-
tory of St. Columba's early life are all situated
in this neighbourhood, namely, Gartan, where
he was born: Tulach-Dubhglaisse, now Tem-
ple-Douglas, in the parish of Conwall, about
half way between Letterkenny and Gartan,
in the parish of Conwall, where he was bap·
tized, by the individua] mentioned in the text3
Killmicuenain, where he was fostered; and
Rath-enaigh, or Rath-maighe-enaigh, in Tir-
enna, now Raymochy‚ in the barony of Ra-
phoe, whither he resorted with his teacher, to
hear the instruction of Bishop Brugaeh, son of
Deagadh. (O'Donnell, i. 22-32‚ Tr. Th. p. 393.)
The old chureh of Kilmacrenan stood a little
N. E. of the village of tho same name, and be-
side it, on the N. Ε.1 are the remains, priucipally
the south wall, of a small Franciscan monas-
tery. The 0‘Firghils, now Freels, a family of
the Cinel-Conaill, were the hereditary war-dens
of this chureh, whose privilege it was to inau-
gurate the chiefs ofthe O'Donnells, a eeremony
which usually took place at the Rock of Doon

in this parish. This civil distinction was pro-
bably the reason why the name of the parish
was extended to the barony, under the English
administration.

d Globum iyneum.—A ball of fire was seen
over the place where St. Declan was born.
(Colg. Act. SS. p. 601 [recte 5ἰ 1] a.) The mo-
ther of St. Mochaomhoc lest her infant asleep
in her house, and„ returning= witnessed a pro-
digy similar to thatin the text. (lb. p. 590 α.)
St. Comgall's mother beheld a pillar of fire
that extended from heaven to the head of her
sleeping infant. (Flem. Collect. p. 304 b.) The
place where St. Brigid lay when an infant was
indicated by a similar wonder. (Tr. Th. p.

547 b.) Such portents, however, are not pe-
culiar to hagiology:

*¹ Ecce levis summo de vertice visus Iuli
Fundere lumen apex, tactuque innoxia moui
Lambere flamma comas, et circum tempora pusci.'¹

AEn. ii. 682.

At a later date, “Puero dormienti, cui Servio
Tullio nomen suit, caput arsisse ferunt multor-
um in conspectu.” (Liv. i. 39.) The story in the
text is borrowed from Cummian in almost his
very words, with the addition os the presbyter’s
name (cap. 2).

¹³ synoda—We have no means of ascertain-
ing with certainty the date os this synod, or
the acts of St. Columba which it condemned.
