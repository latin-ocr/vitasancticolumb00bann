The date of Gregory the Great's accession is Sept. 3, 590, within seven years of which
this alleged occurrence may 110 supposed to have taken place. In O’Donnell the cir-
cumstances of the gift are told more in detail, and >he ends the account by saying that
the reliquary was preserved, at the time when he wrote (1 532), in the island of Tory:
‘¹ Estque illud celebre monumentum quod in Torachiai occidua Hibemiae insula in me-
moriam Columbae asservatum Crux magna vulgo appellatur”¹‘. This altar cross is not
now known to exist, but firom the description it xvoqu seem that it was cased in metal,
and adorned with crystal 1105505, like the cross of Cong preserved 111 the Muscum ofthe
Royal Irish Academy.

cuch, ‘ battle‚’ for the reason given by O’DonneU in the passage cited at p. 249, supra.
It is questionable whether the writing of tho manuscript be as old as st. Columba's
age, though its claim to be considered in the handwriting of St. Columba derives some
weight from the great veneration in which it was formerly held, notwithstanding the
total absence of decoration. It is a curicus particular 111 its contem, that the reading
of Psal. xxxiii. 1 1, differs from that which is cited by Adamnan as the subject of St.
Columba’s last actos penmanshipm. Of the silvcr case, which 15 now its most attractive
feature, it is unnecessary to offer any description 11010, as a detailed account. m'th
drawings sufficiently accurate to give a fair idea of its stmetum, can easily 110 consulu-dn.
The inscription, however, which runs along three sides of the margin of the under
sursuce, is worthy of being correctly recorded :
