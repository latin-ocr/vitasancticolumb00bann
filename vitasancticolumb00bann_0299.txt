present day regard a bishop whose patent or
rescript emanated from Donnybrook οι· Balli-
nasloe instead of Westminster or the Vatican‘?
Taillte is now called Teltown, which is formed
from Corticessnn. the genitive ease ofthe word,
agreeably to a, common process in anglicizing
Irish names. We find eiu Canceonn in Mar.
Gorman, May 18, and cench [uult-eun in the
Calendar ofDonegal at the same day. In the old
'l'axations of the diocese of Meath, Kiltalcyn is
the form in which the name appears. Teltown is
a small parish adjoining Kells on the south-east,
and possesses not only a cemetery and the ruins
ofan old chin-ch, but the remains ofa large rath
and other ancient works (Ord. Survey, s. 17).
On the origin ofthe name, and the ancient im-
portance of the place, see Keating’s Hist. (vol.
i. pp. 192. 2 10, ed. Haliday); O'Flaherty, Ogyg.
111, 13, 56 (pp. 177, 304); Four Mastem, An.
Mund. 3370, and Dr. O'Donovan's note (vol. i.
p. 22). Colgan, misled by an incon-eet copy
of Cod. A.‚⁵reads Hiseilte, which he proposes
to change (a favousite process with him) to
GeseHde, that he may bring the word round to
Geisille, the old name os Geashill 111 the King's
County (Tr. Th. pp. 364 b, 385 b, n. 4). The
Bollandist editor follows Colgan, and adds, on
his own responsibility, the Latin preposition, to
govern Hisez‘lle in the ablative case.

’Δ Finnionem.-Cummian, from whom this
anecdote appears to be borrowed, calls him
Finnianus, and identifies him with the indivi-
dual whom Adamnan calls Findbarrus in ii. 1

(p. 103) supra. St. Columba, as has been oba
served in the note on that place, had two
teaohers called Fiunian, and the authorities
there cited refer the event related in that pas-
sage to the Finnian of Magh-bile, to whom also
the present narrative would seem resemble.
In support of this choiee, it may be observed
that Adamnan in both places calls Finnian
hislam,- and that while Finnian of Magh-bile
is generally acknowledged to have been of this¹
order, Finniau of Clonard is nowhere, either 111
his Life or the Calendars. so designated, and
tho only place where he is called a bishop is in
the Lise of St. Columba of Tirdaglas (Colg.
Act. SS. p. 404 α). 011 the other hand, there
is no reference to St. Columba in the published
Lives of the former Finnian, with whom tradi-
tion describes him as being engaged in a se-
rious dispute (p. 104, supra), while the Life of
St. Finnian of Clonard not only numbers St.
Columba among his diseiples, but refers to the
present interview 111 the following words :
“ Quodam tempore S. Finnianus intuens suum
discipulum Columbam Kille venientem ad se,
ait uni de suis Monachis3 Vide comitem iti-
neris Columbae. Et respondit 111ος video An-
gelos Dei in comitatu ejus. Et ait Finnianus,
vere qui adhaeret Deo, unus spiritus est eum
eo.*‘-c. 30 (Colgan, Act. SS. p. 397 a).

ὓ Mayz‘strum.-St.12'innian of Clonard is com-
memorated in the Calendar at Dec. 12, where
