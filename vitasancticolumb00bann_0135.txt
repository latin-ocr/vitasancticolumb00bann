numbers the Moudus among the nine great
rivers of Ireland (Top. Hib. i. 6). The Ui

now the barony of Tireragh in Sligo, occupied
the right side of the rivom and the U] Ornat-

of this river with Wexford Harbour.—Ethnog.

¹1 Eirros Domno -Now the barony of Erris,
in the county of Mayo. It is principally occu-
pied by the enormous parish of Kileommon,
extending over 203396 acres. The Irish al-
ways styled the territory lonnur Oonlnssnn,
‘ Erris of the Damnonii‚¹ and supposed that it
derived that name from the Ρηι Ὸοτῇηαηη,
Viri Dumnonii, a. section of the Firbolgs. See
Kcating's History, vol. i. pp. 188, 190; also
compare pp. 132, 144, 168, 363, 398. (Ed.
Haliday.) lnbher Domuonu, the old name of
the mouth of the Malahide river, near Dublin,
now disguised in Muldowney, was derived from
the same source. The word lonpup orlpnup
signifles ‘a promontory‚' and is applied, simply,
or in composition, to many places on the coasts
of Galway‚ Kerry, and Donegal. See Hardi-
man's West Connaught‚ pp. 73, 96, 97 ς Curry's

⁷⁴ Cale Drehene.—Praef.ii. p. 9. The Calendnr
of Donegall, at June ιο, states this place to
have been between Drumcliff and Sligo: to
which may be added Colgan's authority, ‘⁴ Est
loeus hic in regione Carbriae in Connacia, non
procul a Sliguensi oppido, versus Aquilonem
situs.⁷' (Tr. Th. p. 452 α, Π, 3.) The old
church of Drumcliff is about four miles north
os Sligo, so that the districtiu which the battle
was fought is determined, though the name is
locally forgotten. The circumstances ol* the

‘battle are thus recorded by Tighernach:

Α. C. 560, ⁸ The death of Curuan son of Eo>

violation of the protection ofColum-chille3 and
this was the cause of the battle of Cul-Dreimh⁴
ne.‘' A. C. 561, ‘¹ The battle of Cul-Dreimhnv
against Diarmaid son of Cerbaill. Fergus and
DomhuaU, the two sons ol= Muircertach mac
Earca, aud Aiumire son of Setina, and Nin-
nigh, son ofDuach, and Aedh son oonchaidh
Tirmcarna, King of Connaught. were victors
through the prayers of Colum-cille.''

The engagement took place in Carbury‚ tiu⁴
territory of the Cinel Cairbre‚ a braneh of the
northern Hy Neill, on the confines of Connaught
and the Cinel Conaill; between the chiefs οἱ
the northern and southern Hy Neill, probably
at the instance of St. Columba, whose right>
had been violated by Diarmait, the sovercign
of Ireland, in the murder of Curnan. See

408); Ussher, Brit. Eccl. Ant. cap. ¹7 (Wks.
