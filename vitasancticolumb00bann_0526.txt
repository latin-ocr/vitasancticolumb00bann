in the total 360, to complete its absurdity. There probably never were more than two
dozen real crosses standing at any one time ; and if every tombstone in the cemeteries
which ever had a cross of any form inscribed on it were included, the number 360
would not be arrived at. 1f some were thrown into the sea, why any left standz'ny 52 If
the rest were deported, who, at that moment, uniocked the shores of Hy, or created an
appetite not hitherto felt abroad? Or, if there were no fine crosses previously to 1560
elsewhere, how came Hy to have created an art unknown in other places, or, if known,
to monopolize its development ? Mr. David Laing justly observes that there are
grounds for ‘¹ believing that the statements so frequently and confidently repeated by
later writers, from the time of Sachevcrel in 1688, of the number of 360 Stone Crosses
having existed in the Island, should be considered as very apocryphal, and their al-
leged destruction by thc Reformers aS‚ at best, a vag-ue tradition”¹ (Letter to Lord

Mur-ray, 1854, p. 12).

1. St. Martin'e Grais, opposite the west door of the Cathedral, a noble monument,

record 111 the Proceedings of the R. Irish Acad.
vol. vi. p. 390. Arguing from the character, com-
pared with that ou Lachlann Mac Fingone’s cross-
shaft in Hy, thch is dated 1489, Mr. Smith re-
fers this cross to the same ρει-ἱράς and he has
judged rightly, as the following record will prove:
‘'A. D. 1515, James V. presented to the rectory
of Kilquhoan [or Kincnoax} in Ardnamurcfflme,
vacant by ‘che decease of sir Axnnnw Mum-
cunm-'E'' (Orig. Par. ii. p. 194). This individual
was also rector of Ellenenan, or Ehnfinan, now
called Sunart (ib. p. 198). But Kilchoan is the
phonetic form of Kil-coman (so called from St.
Comghan of Oct⁴ 13, in the Scotch and Iris-h Ca—
lendars), which appears on the· cross, and as that
cross was erected during the incumbency of a man
who died no later thau 1515, we may reasonably
refer the execution of the work to 1500, only eleven
years subsequent to the date assigned 111 Mr. Smith's
judicious conjecture. The sui-name Mac Heachyrna
is commonly written Mac Eachern, and in the
county of Anu-im has assumed the form M scaffe-
ron ; while, in Clare, the O'Echtiyerns‚ who were
chiefs of a small territory N.W. of Limerick, are
now called Ahern. The origin of the name,
euclffilssesm (Equorum dominus, ἱππόδαμος),
was very common in Ireland. Thus Eachtigh-
ern, son of Flann of Manister (i. e. monaster-

boyce), was himself, in 1067, herenach of that
monastery, established 3 family name, and was
succeeded by Eoghan Mac Echtigheirn, who died
in 1 1 17 3 and the latter by Feargna Mac Echtigh-
eirn, who died in 1122. In Scotland the family
was called Clam· Eetiyearna, (Collectan. p. 56).
They were freeholders under the Lords of the Isles
(ib. p. 297), and in the fifteenth century held un-

» der them eight marklands in Kilblane, at the S. E.

extremity of Cantyre, with the Mayoralty-of-see
of the lordship of Kintire, which were confirmed
to Colin in 1499 by James IV.⁷ but in ¹554 passed
away from the family (orig. Par. ii. 10). In
1605, John Grown Mac Vic Kechem was foster-
father of Gillecallum Makfeithe of Colonsay, and
¹· officear” of the island. He had two sons, Archi-
bald and Gillecallum (Collectan. p. 203). Colin
Makauchern, of 1499, is probably the Cuilin of the
genealogy (ib. p. 56). The writer has collected the
above details, which he hopes will prove a satisfac-
tory comment on this interesting inscription: at all
events, they show that the cross, instead of being an
importation from Hy, is probably standing in its
original pai-ish (ΚίΖ-εἰαναη), and records the name
of an old family of an adjoining one.

¹ Tradition.—There is, however, nothing in such
a tradition inconsistent with the Reformation move-
ment in scotland.
