Presace. xxiii
saint of Augia Rheni, or Rheinauw, had made his way to Germany about
twenty-five years before, and his Life, which was written a short time after his
decease, though existing in Germanyg proves the writer to have been an Irish-
man, and acquainted with Irish occurrenceS‚ for it contains some sentences in
the Irish language, and speaks of a monk then living in Fore, to whom the
saint had related the visions which he had at Rheinau. And, that it was not
unusual to carry books abroad, appears by the many Irish manuscripts which
are preserved on the Continent, and, especially, from the donations which
Dangaly made to St. Columbanus's monastery of Bobio, and Bishop MarcusZ to
that of St. Gall. The discovery of the manuscript of Adamnan at Reichenau
by White, and the communication of his copy to Ussher‚ Colgan‚ and the
Bollandjsts‚ have been already mentioned“. then or by whom it was removed
from that monastery is not known, but that it found its way to Schaffhausenb
before the suppression in 1799 has been shown above. Dr. Ferdinand Keller,
who has the credit of bringing it to light again, thus writes, J an. 1 851 ε “ The
present proprietor of the MS. of S. Columba is the Town-library (public
library) of Schaffhausen. Here I found this codex in 184 ς at the bottom of a

w Rhemum-Thu is, ¹ Meadow oftheRhine;' “Librum quendam Scotaicae linguae.” lb. col.

in Latin, Auyz'a Rheni. It is situate on a pic-
turesque island of the Rhine, not sar from the
cataract beside Sehaffhausen.

¹ Germany.—Published by Goldastus in his
Rerum Alamannicarum Scriptores, p. 318 (Fran-
cof. 1606). The saint, who was a native of
Leiuster‚ is called Findan in the Life.

5 Dunyal.— The catalogue of the books which
this Irishman gave to the monastery of Bobio
has been published from an ancient M S. by Mu-
ratori (Antiq. ltal.Disse1·t. 43, tom. iii. col. 821).
The memorandum prefixed to the catalogue
states that they were the books “quos Dun-
galus praecipuus Scottorum obtulit beatissimo
Columbano,” that is, to his monastery, sor the
founder of Bobio was now 200 years dead. A
manuscript 'm the Ambrosian Library at Milan,
formerly iu the Bobio collection, has these
lines 2

“ Sancte Columba. tihi Scotto tuus incola Dungal
Tradidit hunc Librum, quo Fratrum corda beenturs·

lb. col. 826. Dungal‘s catalogue mentions

821 (Mediol. 1740).

² Marcam—In 841, Marcus, an Irish bishop,
and his sister's son, Moengal (latinized Mar—
cellus), returning from a pilgrimage to Rome,
visited St. Gall, and were induced to make it
iu future their home. Marcus bequeathed his
books to the monastery, aud Moengal became
director of the inner school, and teacher uf
those boys who wore the cloister dress, and
were, for the most part, while yet children,
devoted to the monastic life. See Keller, ut
snpra, p. 63.

⁸ Mentioned—See pp. ix.‚ x.‚ sztpra; Acta
Sanctorum, Junii, ii. p. ¹90 α.

¹³ Sclzaff'hause11.-'l'he identity of the Ms.
now existing there with that formerly seen at
Reichenam is put beyond the shadow osa doubt
by two memoranda on the first page, which,
though partially erased, admit ol> being read:
one at the top of p. 1, col. α, Liber Auytae Dc-
vitis,· the other at the foot of the page, Lib*
anglie maioris.
