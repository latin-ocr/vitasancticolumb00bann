0 Sala-See chap. 19 (p. 128) supra. The
river Shiel, which connectsbthe fresh-water lake
of Loch Shiel with the sea, and forms part of
the boundary between the counties of Inverness
and Argyle, is excluded from identification with
the name in the text, because it was a S. E. wind
which conveyed the party from it to Hy, where-
as a N. E. wind would be required to do this
from beyond Ardnamurchan. We must there-
fore leave this name unidentified.

¹¹ Duodecim carneis—We find this number
prevailing, during the early ages os Chris<
tianity, in almost every department of reliyious
See iii. 4, infra. It waS, however,
largely adopted in secular use also: thus we
read of Vortigern's 12 Druids (Irish Nennius,
p. 90); the 12 battles of Arthur (lb. p. 108);
the 840 [70 >< 12] men whom he slew in one
day (lb. p. 112); the 12 soldiers and Cadoe
(Vit. Cad. c. 5, Rees, Lives‚ p. 32): the 12 horse-
men (lb. c. 20, p. 53); the 12 workmen (lb.
c. 17, p, 46); the 12 companions of Oswald
(i. 1, p. 15, supra); the 12 soldiers of Eanfrid
(Bede, H. E. iii. 1); Oswy's donation of the
¹·du0decim possessiunculae terrarum'’ (lb. iii.
24); and the crew of 12 in the Orkney boat
(Johnstone Antiqq. Celt. Scand. p. 262).

’ἓ Renovandum monasterium—See note ³, cap.
3 (p. 106) supra. An improvement seems to
have been made, before this. on the rude sys-
tem of building with wattles. St. Columba
used to study in a hut “tabulis suffultum“ (i.
25, p. 54, supra). St. Finan, in 652, erected a
church after the model of Hy, “quam more
Scottorum, non de lapide, sed de robore secto
totam composuit, atque harundine texit ;'' that
ἦε, the walls were made of wooden sheeting,
which was protected from the weather outside

economy.

by a coat of rush thatch. Au improvement
was again made on this system when a sue·
ceeding bishop, ‘¹ ablata harundine, plumbi
laminis eam totam, hoc est, et tectum et ipsos
quoque parietes ejus cooperire curaviff' (Βεᾱρ,
Η. Ε. iii. 25). In the same manner Paulinus.
having visited Glastonbury (the lnyswitrin of
note Ἄ, p. 106, supra), “muros vetustae ecclesiae
ligneo tabulatu construere fecit, et extra a
summo usque deorsum in terram plumbo un-
dique cooperire feeit'’ (Gul. malmesbur, ap.
Ussher, wks. v. p. ¹4¹)- The church of St. Peter
at York was also first “de ligno'' (Bede, H. Ε.
ii. 14). Stone building was considered at the
time characteristic of Roman practice. Ni-
nian's ehurch of Whithern, among the southern
Picts, got its name Candida Casa “eo quod
ibi ecclesiam de lapide, insolito Brittonibus
more fecerit'' (lb. iii. 4); and Naiton, king of
the northern Picts, in 7¹0· “architectos sibi
mitti petiit, qui juxta morem Romanorum ec-
elesiam de lapide in geute ipsius facerent'⁷ (Ιῦ.
ν. 21). Thus also Biscop Benedict‚ in 676,
brought over from Gaul “camentarios qui lapi-
deam sibi ecclesiam juxta Romanorum morem
sacereut” (ld. Hist. Abb. Wirem. ς’ 5). ln Ire-
land the national taste seems to have displayed
itself in the same manner as in Britain. When
St. Palladius came to Ireland, “tres ecclesias
de robore extructas suudavit” (Jocel. c. 25, Tr.
Th. p. 70 b). St. Patrick visited Tirawley‚ ‘⁵ et
fecit ibi aecclesiam terrenam de humo quadr-a<
tarn quia non prope erat silva'' (Tirechan. Lib.
Armac. fol.14bl2). St. Monenna of Cill-Sleibhe-
Cuilinn, died in 517. Derlaisre was her third
successor: ‘¹ In cujus tempore contigit in omni
scotia famosum et tam grande miraculum,
