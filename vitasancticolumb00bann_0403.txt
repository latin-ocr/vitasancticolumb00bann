Tm: desire which prcvailed, in the early ages of Christ-lanity, to imitate even th<-
aceidentai features of the apostolic system, naturally suggested the adoption of the
number Twelve 'm the adjustment of religious sociefies3 and its use was afterwards
extended to other relations, both soei-„11 and moral. We find in Adamnan the mention
of King Oswnld and his twelvc companjons (p. 15, supra); of twelve years as a term
of monastic service (pp. 52› 2 37, supra) ; of a convoy of fiwelve curachs (p. 177, supra);
and of St. Columba and his twelve disciples. The names of these twelve followers
have been given iu note A (p. 245, supra); and the fonowing recita] win serve as a
commentar-y on that list, in showing the prevale-nce of the duodecimal economy among
tho Irish as well as the other inhabitants of the British Isles :-
