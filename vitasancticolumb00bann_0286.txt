also that of bishop Columbanus (iii. 12,insra).
On the present occasion the chief commemora-
tion of St. Columba was reserved till noon.

³ Natalis Columba· et Raithenoi.—That is, the
ninth of June. St. Baithene, the immediate
successor of St. Columba, was his first cousin,
being son of Brendan, brother of Fedhlimidh.
He was younger than St. Columba, being only
sixty-six years of age at his death, which oe-
curred in 599, after a presidency of three years.
His acts are preserved in the Codex Salmanti-
rensis at Brussels (fol. 201), from which they
were printed by the Bollandists immediately
after those of St. Columba. (sumi, tom. ii. ppv
236-238.) In them we find the following allu-
sion to the coincidence of his and St. Columba's
festival: “Tertia feria, dum S. Baithinus in
ecclesia juxta altare Dominum oraret, sopor
pene mortis super eumillic cecidit: cum autem
Fratres eirca eum lamentarentur, Diermitius
minister Columbae, ait: Ecce, Fratres, videtis,
quod inter duas solennitates seniorum vestro-
rum magnum intervallum non erit. Haec eo
dicente Baithinus, qnasi de gravi somno exei-
tatus ait; Si inveni gratiam in oculis Dei, et si
rursum perfectum in conspeetu ejus consum-
maverim usque hodie; ego confido in eov quod

quod sic fere post sex dies factum est.”--c. 10
(Jun. ii. p. 238 a). The joint festival is thus
notieed in the Feilire of AEnguS‚ June 9:

¹³ Adhuc exstant—This expression seems to
indicate that a considerable interval had
elapsed between the occurrence and the pre-
sent narrative of it.

³ Bis maworn—The disease here referred
to belonged to the class called by the Irish
δαῑοῃ ὺυιύθ, ‘yeliow disorder,’ and was
known by the specifie name Onon Chonmu,
or buioe choncuu. In Britain it bore the
name of Vnd Velm, and was commonly called
the ‘Yellow Plague.’ (Lhuyd‚ Archaeol. voc.
cenail.) “Flava pestis, quam et Physici ic-
tericiam dicunt passionem.'' (Girald. Cambr.
