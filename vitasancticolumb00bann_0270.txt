166 Vita Sancti Columbce

[Lm. 11.

es ad feminarum emigrare monasteriolum? Illa, Nunc, inquit, cognovi quia
tua Deo de me est ¹² audita orati03 nam quem heri oderam, hodie amo3 cor
enim meum hac nocte praeterita, ¹³quo modo ignoro, ¹⁴in ¹⁵me ¹⁶immutatum
est de odio in amorem. Quid moramur? ab 17eadem die usque ¹⁹ad diem
obitus, ¹⁸ani1na ejusdem maritae indissociabiliter in amore conglutinata est
mariti, ut illa maritalis concubitus debita, quae prius reddere renuebat, nullo
modo deinceps recusaret.

Nepos Leathain, iii. 17, infra. This surname,
in Irish Ua lineam, is met with in the Calen-
dax· at Oct. 213 Ann. Inisfall. 718; and the
Four blusters, 865, where a second Cormac
Ua Liathain is mentioned, who is called in the
parallel entry of the Ann. Ult. (866) Nepos
Linthain. The Ul liuram, Nepotes Letlumi,
were a clau descended. and deriving their
name, from Eochaidh Liathain, or Liathanacb,
a Munster chief, who was sixth in descent from
Oilill Olum, King of Munster. A.D. 234. Crim-
thann Mor, nephew of this Eoohaidh Liathain.
was monareh of Ireland from 366 to 3783 so
that we may consider the middle of the fourth
century as the period at which the latter flou-
rished. In after times, the name of the Ui
Liathain was given to their territory, and the
lordship of it became hereditary in the family
of O'hAnmcadha (Four Mast. 745, 760, 1014;
Cambrens. Evers. vol. i. pp. 273, 277, reprint).

About the same period, when dioceses in Ire-
land were partitioned into rural deanries‚ Ole-
ιῘιαη became the name ofa deam-y inthe diocese
of Cloyne, and appears on the ancient Taxa-
tion Roll as a district extending over eighteen
parishes, the principal of which was Castrum
Olethan. now Castle-Iyons. ln the Regal Visi-
tation of 1615 the decanatus de Casae-lyon
represented the same portion of the diocese.
The territory was situated in the south-east of
the present county of Con-k, and is now nearly
represented by the bai-onies of Barrymore and
Kinnatalloon. According to the pedigrees of
Cormac given in the Book of Lecan, he was
son of Dima, son of Coman, son of Cudumaig,
son of Congal, son of Cairbre, son of Sionach,
son of Eochaidh Liathain. The pedigree in
Mac Firbis is incorr-eet in making Daire Cerb
his grandfather (Geneal. MS. p. 740 a). On
the name Ua Liathain, see O'Flaherty, Ogyg.

Olehan was granted to Robert Fitz Stephen,
from whom it passed to William de Barry.
