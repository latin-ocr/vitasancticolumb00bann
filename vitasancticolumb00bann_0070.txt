sun demand. Adamnan's demand was, that a complete restoration of the captives
should be mado to him, and that no Saxon should ever again go upon a predatory ex-
cursion to Erin; and Adamnan brought back all the captives.” The secret of his
success is told by Adamnau liixziseli'1, “ regem Aidffidum visitantes amicum ;” and the
result is bricfly but satisfactorily stated by the Annals at 687, which is 686 according
10 Bcde : “ Adamnan conducted sim}- captives to Ircland.” It may have been about
this period that the Synod was held in Irelaud to which Adanman alludcs at p. 178 ;
his languagc at the end of the chapter (p. 182) seems to regar-d it as an occurrence of
some standing when hc wrote. It is to be rcgretted that he gives no clue to the year,
object, or place of mce‘u'ng. At the time of his first visit to Aldfrid, a great mortality
prevassed in Europe, from which, however, the Scots and Picts of North Britain were
providentially cxcm1)ted‘²¹; and ‚two years afterwards, when he undertook a second
journcy to the N orthumbrian court, disease was still ravaging the country, although not
permitted to touch him or one of his attendants. The object of this visit is not stated
by Adamnan, but it probably was some matter of international policy which Adamnan
was choscn to negotiate. The fact that he sailed direct to hela-nd with the liberatcd
captives in 686, seems to justify the reference of the following statement in Bede¹¹ to
a later date, when he returned to Hy, and subsequently crosscd over to Ireland ι

nan's voyage to Ireland3 but of that presently. In reference ‘to this visit he gives the
following interesting account of Adamnan's tract 011 the Holy Places: “ Scripsit idem
