ing one attendant (54, 84, 143), who occasionally read to him (65); or by two, who
stood at the door, awaiting his orders (z 16, 227). Here was his lectulus (²33)- The
door was provided with a lock and key (22 3, 226). When a strangor arrived, a hospi-
tz'zcmv (27, 157) was prepared for him. When a member died, he was laid out, and
waked in his lodging (239).
There was a Smithy, probably insidc the enclosure; and in an institution where
timber was so generally uscd, there must have been a carpenter⁷s work-
shop. We may conclude that there was such au appointment noar the Offia‘nae.
beach also, for large beams of timber, in their rough state, were sometimes
fioated from the shores of the mainland to the island, and fashioncd there into boats (176).
All these buildings were embraced by a rampart and fosse, called the vallum* (143),
which, in other Irish monaster-iffi, was of a circular figure, and was intended more for
the restraint than the sccmity of the inmatcs. It is doubtful whether the
ccmctery was within thc 1·(tll1c1tz; probably it was, and, if 50, the position of Vultum
the Rcilig Odhrain would hclp to determino the site of the monastery, and
to assign it to the space now partially occupied by the Cathedral and its several ap-
pcndages.
Outside thc vallum* were the various officcs and appointments subsidiary to tlu-
1nonastery; as thc Beatum, with its cows; the Horreum, with its grain;
the Canaba, with its appiu·t011anccs; tho Molemlinsum, with its pond and miH- Scissum.
stream the Proeclium, with its horso and (·art; and tho Partim, with its craft
of various sizos. These appondagcs occupied different situations, according to local
convenience. Ι
The pasture-ground, with its bocetum 01· hyrc-³* (231), called by the Iris-h buculus
or booley, was situate 011 the eastern side of the island, at some distance from
the monastery, and for this reason thc lactaria vascula (1 25, z 3 1) wore usually nocetum.

which was securcd by a 9erqenna (1'b.), passing through bina foramina in the sides (ili).

*Hospitium—ln some Irish monasteries there
was a separate department called lup, or ceeh
ueioet'), ‘ enclosure' or ⁴ house of guests: as in Ar-
magh (F. Mast. 1003, ¹0¹5= 1116, 1155); and
Clonmacnois (ib. 1031, 1093, 1106, 1128, 1166).

W Vallum—Such was the enelosure of Armagh
called pach Opbmuchu (F. Mast. 1091, 1112,
1 196). The monastery ot* Derry was erected in the
dun of Aedh (160). See pp. 24, 143, cupra. In
1266, when the Francisean monastery of Armagh,
now known as the Abbey in the Primate's Demesue,
was founded, they “cut a broad aud deep trench

around their church'' (Four Masters).

Χ Outside tlte Vallum—The Benedictine Rule rc-
quircd that, is possible, ¹⁸ onmia necessaria, id est.
Aqua, Molendiuurn, Hortus, Pistrinum, vel Artes
diversae, intra monasterium exerceantur, ut non sit
necessitas monachis vagabundi foras'' (cap. 66).

lar proverb, ’Sfar a m-bi bo, bi'dll beaw* 'sfar α
m-bi bean, bi'dlz mallaclmdh. ‘where there is a
