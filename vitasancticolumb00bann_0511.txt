Sur-named Ua Brolchain. The family of Ua Brolchain were descended from Suibhne
Mearm, who was king of Ireland in 615, and belonged to the Cinel ΓεταᾱΙιαίεΙι, a clun so
called from Feradhach, grandfather of that Suibhue Meann, and fourth in descent from Eoghan,
the founder of the Cinel-Eoghain race. The Cinel Feradhaieh arc now territorially represented
by the barony of Clogher, in the south of the county of Tyrone. The first of the O'Brolchan
family who is mentioned in the Annals was Maelbrighde Ua Broxchan, styled pmm Γοθῐὶ
enenn [‘ chief mason of Ireland'—Old Vers.], whose obit is entered in the Anu. Ult. at 1029.
From him probably the maeonio art of the family was derived. which was cultivated by Flaherty,
and practised by Donnell, with such success. The next was Maeliosa, the lector whose obit is
entered above at 1036. He spent a part of his early life at Both-chonaiss in Inishowen‚ in the

mention is made in the Four Masters at 850, 987,

Comgau, great—grandson of Eoghan, the head of
Cinel-Eoghain. Its situation was well known to
Colgart who describes it as in Inishowenv and says,
“hodie locus prophanatus estl’ (Act. SS. p. 108 b,
11. 5); but iu modern times it has eluded the dili-
