¹³ Irish.—The Dauphin, in Shakspeare’s Henry
the Seventh, alludes to the national custom when
he says, “Yon rode like a keme of hehnd, your
Freneh hose off, and in your strait trossers'' (iii. 7).

¹ Straw.—Adamnau says that Columba's bed was
a bare stone: the Vit. Secund. of Colgan adds⁷ “in-
tei-posito tantum corio.”-cap. 18 (Tr. Th. p. 327 a).
It would seem that hides were occasionally used for

give the name boile, ‘town' to this conventual
establishment, in accordance with the practice which
is obser-ved in many ancient Lives‚ of calling a mon-
