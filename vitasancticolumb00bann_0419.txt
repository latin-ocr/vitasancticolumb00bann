Nortmannorum pyraticae classis Dux, ferro et flamma septemtrionales Britanniae partes
devastans, venit ad Ionam insulam, ubi sacra prophanis Sathanae Satelh'tes miscentes:
direptis omnibus, quae occurrerant, terram hine inde fodiunt, latentes, ut putabant,
thesauros inquirentes; ac inter alia effodiunt Sarcophagum seu aream, in qua verus
erat, licet non eui iHi inhiabant, thesaurus, nempe S. Columbae corpus. Arcam ad na-
vem portant, quam postea versus Hiberniam tendentes aperiunt: et tum nihil inclusum,
praeter hominis ossa, ac cineres, reperiunt, clausam in mare projieiunt3 quae Dei nutu,
Oceani fluetibus agitata, et per undas injecta, reperitur in sinu maris Dunensi urbi vi-
cino, undis supernatans. Quam sie repertam, et divina revelatione agnitam, aperiens
Abbas Monasterii Dunensis, sanctum thesaurum area extract-um, in eisdem lipsanis cum
Divorum Patricii, et Columbae [recte Brigidae] saeris exuviis recondidit'’⁰. The earliest
recorded deseent of the Northmen on Hy is 802, which is only five years anterior to
the writing of the Book of Armagh.

N otwithstanding this reputed interment, whether in Sani or Down, we find that
on the occasion of St. Blaithmae’s martyrdom, in 825, St. Columba's shrine, Which
was adorned with precious metals, was the chief object of the murderous Northmen’s
search3 so Walafridus Strabus states:

“Ad sanctum venere patrem, pretiosa metalla
Reddere cogentes, queis saneti sancta Columbae
Ossa jacent, quam quippe suis de sedibus arcam
Tonantes tumulo terra posuere cavato,

Cespite sub denso gnari jam pestis iniquae:
Hanc praedam cupiere Damna

How soon, or by whom, the shrine was brought to light from its place of eoneeahnent,
is not recorded3 but we know that it was soon after removed to Ireland, for in 878 it
was transferred, together with all St. Columba's mimus, to heland, for seeurity from
the Danes, where it probably rcmained. Now, it is remarkable, that whereas we hear
of Adamnan‘s relies at 727, 730, m'thin twenty-four years after his death, we find
no mention of St. Cohunba’s tffl eighty years afterwards. Possibly, indeed, in the pro-
mulgat-lon of the Lez Cbluimcille in 753, 757, 778, his shrine may have been borne about
as the warrant for the exaction of this religious tributey and thus an indirect evidence
