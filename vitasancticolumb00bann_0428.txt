pontifici Kcntegemo, in ecclesia Sancti Wilffidi episcopi et confessoris apud Ripum,
multo tempore conservabatur3 et propter utriusque sanctitatem, dantis videlicet et

Sancti Wilfia‘di de Ripoun, aureis crustulis inclusus, ac margaritarum diversitate eir-
cnmstellatus, cum magna reverentia adhuc scrvatur’‘³.
