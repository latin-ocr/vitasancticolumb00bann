v. 3, 4. This volume contains the lives oftwenty-eight samem, all Irish,
except St. Anthony. It is written in double columns. The chapters are not
numbered by the original hand, and are only distinguished by large red initials.
Its text is of the shorter recension, but differs from the other MSS. of the
same family in occasionally departing from the usual order of the Chapters, and
by reducing Adamnan’s involved constructions to the more natural order of
the words. It generally substitutes Hyber7zia¹¹ for scotia, Hyhernienses for
Scotienses ‚· and, when it comes to an Irish name, departs from the usual mo—
nastic hand, and writes the word in the native character0. Itis almost certain
that this is the manuscript which Ussher speaks of when, citing Adamnan‚ he
writesP: “ De Scotia (sive ut MS. meus eodem sensu habet, Hibernia) ad
Britanniam ;” and agaim: ‘⁶ Moctheum enim, in MS. quo usus sum codice, ibi
nominatum invenio: pro quo Mauetius in libris Adamnani editis.”

V. Codex F. A vellum manuscript in 4to. saeo. x.‚ consisting of fifty leaves.
It formerly belonged to the clim-ch of Freisingen‚ situate at the J unction of
the Moosach and Isar‚ in Bavaria3 under the number 141, and is now in the
Royal Library of Munieh, 6341. It is the most respectable manuscript of the
shorter recension‚ and often exhibits the proper names in a very correct form.
It was eollated for this edition in 1853, by Professor Conrad Hofmann of
Munioh, and the facsimile in Plate IV. No. 1, was made by Mr. Schenk of

that city. The memorandum at top of the first page, Iste liber est sancte

has been frequently referred to, was given to
it by the late Mr. Downes, who conjectured
that some Lives published by Colgan from a

Codex Killeenniensis were taken from it; but a
slight comparison shows that it is ποι Colgan's
original. Codex Armachanus is more likely to
be its correct designation.

Besides No. 2, Nos. 4, 20, 21 have been liberally
eonsulted for the present work. Cod. E. 3, 11,
of Trinity College Library, is a collection of
Irish Lives bearing a great resemblance to
this, but greatly inferior in value on account
of its numerous chasms. The Lives of Colman
Eia, Barr, and Albeus, contained in it, are oc-
casionally referred to in this work.
