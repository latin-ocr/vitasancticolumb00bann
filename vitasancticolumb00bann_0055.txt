the deficient c by interlineation, which looks as if the copyist was not familiar

and the only Scotch tracts are the Lives of St. Ma1·garet1 and St. Ninianm.

Resides these seven manuscripts, which furnish the various readings of this
edition, there are reported to be in existence the following :—

1. At Admontn, a cathedral town of Styria, in the circle of J udenburg‚
and valley of the Enns river, a manuscript Vita S. Colambae presbyteri ec
confessoris, beginning ‘⁶ Sanctus igitur Columba nobilibus suerat oriundus na-
talibus, patrem habens Fedihnitum filium Fergusa.”

2. He2·lzyenkreutz0 (Holy-Cross), in Austria‚ is reported as having a Vita S.
Columbae. There are eight places os the name in the Austrian empire3 but
of the two which are in the arohduchy of Austria, this is probably the Cis-
tereian monastery, in the district of the Vienna forest.

3. Salmansweilerv, a Cistercian monastery, one mile from Uberlingen, on
the north side of the lake of Constance, is reported to have Adamamms Abbas-
de Vita S. Columbe 0077 essoris.

and the lakes of Sehlier and Tegern, is said to hare Vita Columbz‘ Con essoris,-

ς. In the Codex Salmanticensis‘, belonging to the library of the Dukes of
Burgundy at Brussels, is a fragment of a Life of St. Columba, differing very
little from Adamnan’s. Owing to the loss of several folios, the greater part
of this tract is wanting, and what remains, beginning at iii. 18 of Adamnan,
is printed by Colgan as the second part of his Vita SecmzdaS.
