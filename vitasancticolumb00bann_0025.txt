of his collation‚ has very often neglected his professed exemplar, and fallen in
with the old readings of the Windberg‚ instead of the British, manuscript.
On the whole, the text is certainly an improvement on that in the Canisian
family, but is greatly inferior to Colgan’s, with which the editor seems to have
been unaoquainted¹‚ for he supplies the (1811818118),ν at the eonunenceinent of
the British manuscript from Canisius’s meagre authority, and, when he might
have drawn from Colgan’s rich store, he adds a few foot 110185, which do more
to prove the editorial incompetency of the commentator than to illustrate the

text of his author.
All who have compared the text of Adamnan as given by Canisius or his

copyists, with that in Colgan‚ the Bollandists, or Pinkerton‚ have observed a
great difference in their length. Ussher noticed the brevity of canisius's

kerton 3 and Dr. Lanigan¹ has gone so far 35 to state it to be 1115 opinion that

have smiled to know (probably some of them
