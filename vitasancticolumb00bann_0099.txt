and, therefore, a more successful course than theirs; but it was equally voluntary:
at least, there is high authority for supposing it to have been 511011. “ Pro Christo pere-
grinari volens, enavigavit‚” the common formula of missionary enterprise‚ is Adamnan's
statoment¹ of his motive: with which Bede's expressioum‚ “ex quo ipse praedicaturus
abiit,’' is in perfect keeping. That he returned more than once, and took an active part
111 civil and religione transactions, is demonstrable from Adammnu. How much oftener
he revisited Ireland is not recorded 3 but these two instanccs are quite sufficient to dis-
prove the perpetuity of 1115 retirement. That he was not banished by sccular influence 15
clear even fi‘om the legend, which represents his dismissal as an ecclesiastical penalty.
Early in the next century, St. Carthach, or Mochuda, was driven by the seeular arm
from his flourishing monastery of Raheu3 but then hc only changed his proxincc, and
established himself at Lismorc⁰. In doing 50, however, he took 1115 fraternity m'th him,
and gave up all connexion with Rahen. But St. Columba, When he departed, sex-cred

ments, still subject to his authority, and he took m'th him no more than the prescrip-
tive attendance of a missionary leader.

Dum-ow, his pn'ncipal Irish monasteryp, lay close to the territory of the prince

When, at a later time, hc revisitcd Irehmd, to adjust the affairs of this house, it seemed
a fitting occasion for him to traverse Meath, and visit Clonmaenoisq, the chief founda-
tion of his alleged persecutor, and the religions centre of his family. Smely, if the
Nmthern Hy Neill had defeated King Diarmait‘, they could easily have sheltered
their kinsman.

In 56 3, St. Columba, now 111 1115 forty-second year, passed over m'th twelvc
attendants to the west of Seotland, possibly 011 the invitation of the provincial king,
to whom he was allied by blood. Adanman relatost some particulare of an interview
which they had this same year; and the Irish Annals record the donation of Hy, as
the result of King Conall's approval. At this time thc island of Hy seems to have
