Preface. xiii

text the chapter but one preceding relates St. Columba’s doings 111 the Campus
Brey, the old name of East Meath, and thus the reference above mentioned is
easy and intelligible. But in the shorter text, where the said passage also
occurs, six of the antecedent chapters, as given in the longer, are omitted, and
the place which is last mentioned is Skye, and further back, for several chap-
ters, the scene is laid in Hy. It is evident, therefore, that the true correlative
to supra memorata does not exist in the shorter text, and, as a necessary eonse-
quence, that it is mutilatedr. Moreover, as regards the tituli, they form an
integral part of each chapter, sor the names which occur in them are often not
repeated, though referred to, in the substance of the chapter, 50 that their re-
moval, as in the Bollandist edition, from their proper places to the beginning os
the books, that they may not break the thread of the story, illustr-ates the prin-
ciple upon which they were entirely omitted in the manuscripts3 and occa-
sionally renders the insertion of some words 111 the text necessary, in order to
complete the construction. Thus, in 1. 49 (92), all thc copies have supra me-
morata munitione, but there is no antecedent mention of a munitio except 111
1110 111111115, which speaks De hello in munitione Cethz'rnss the absence of which
evidently bears witness against the integrity of the shorter text, and, in the
Bollandists, demanded a note of explanation& The very title of Canisius's
manuscript, Incipit prima Pragfiaetio Apolayiaque Admmzani Abbatis suncti scrip-
toris, indicates a later hand; as the Bollandist editor observes& “ quis enim
seipsum sanctum vocet ?” Accordingly, in giving the preference to the
Reichenau manuscript, he comes to 1110 conclusion that the ‘⁶ WVindbergensc
MS. videatur ex hoc desumptum, pluribus rebus, taedio forsitan vocum barbari-
carum, vel librarii incuria, praeterniissis’'¹¹.

work, three contain the longer, and four⁸the shorter text ε these shall now bc

them.
