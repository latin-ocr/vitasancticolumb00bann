a little,· and speaks of the monastery of Hy “in quo ipse requiescit corpoream. But
ere N otker Balbulusb, in the tenth century, borrowed the expression ubi requiescit, a
change had taken place in the condition of the saint’s remains. In the course of the
eighth century it is probable that his bones were disinterred, and deposited in a shrine
or shn'nesz And once enshrined, they were not likely to be restored to the emh, be—
cause every passing year would increase the veneration which led to the first exposm·e.
Yet we find medjaeval tradition confidently setting forth Dovvnpatrick as his resting-
placed, while an original record of very early date claims for the neighbouring church
of Saul the honour of his interment. We might easily reconcile these tivo accounts by
supposing a translation from Saul, as soon as it became a subordinate ehurch, on the
erection of Downpatrick into a bishop’s see. The fragmentary memoirs of St. Patriek
contained in the Book of Armagh were put on record in the eighth centurye, and the
manuscript itself was written‘ about the year 807, by a scribeg whose death took place
in 846. Speaking of the bm'ial of St. Patrick, they add: “ Oolomb cille Spiritu Sancto
instigante ostendit sepulturam Patriciih ubi est confirmat id est in Sabul Patn'cii‘ id est
in aeclesia juxta mare pro undecima ubi est conductio martirum id est ossuum Columb-
cille de Britannia et conductio omnium Sanctorum Hibernioe in die judicii''j. This
enigmatical passage seems to owe its involved construction to thc circumstance of its
having been copied from an earlier authority, in which a portion of the matter con-
sisted of detached explanations, in the form of interlinear glosses, which the copyist,
on account of the peouliar nature of his page, or for some other reason, incorporated
with the text. The following conjectura] restoration is proposed, as exhibiting the
passage in a more intelligible, and possibly more genuine form :—
