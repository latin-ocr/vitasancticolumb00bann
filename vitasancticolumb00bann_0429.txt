find recorded in the Annals of Ulster, at 1166, the violation of a contraet which had
been solemnized in presence of the Coarb of Patrick with the BachaH J esu, and of the
Coarb of Columcisse with the Gospel of Martin. But it was lost soon after; for, in
1182, “ Donnell, son of Hugh O'Louthin, marched with an fflmy to Dunbo, in Dal-
Riada, and there gave battle to the English. The Kinel-Owen were defeated3 and
Randal O'Breslen, Gilehreest O’Kane, and many others, were killed. On this occasion
the English carried off with them the Gospel of St. Martin.” The legend concerning
the invention of this manuscript is borrowed by O'Donnell from the Acts of St. Euge-
nius of Ardstraw and St. Mochonna‚ or Machar, the patron saint of Aberdcen. It
relatos that the people of Tours had lost the clue to the exact spot where St. Martin's
remains were buried, and that on the occasion of St. Columba's visiting their city they
applied to him to point out the place where the body of their patron saint lay, which
he consented to do on condition that he should receive for his portion everything found
111 1110 grave, except the bones of Martin. ‘¹ Conditione facile admissa, vir Sanetus
locum, in quo sacrum corpus jacebat, indigitat, in eoque mox defosso simul cmn desi-
deratis exuviis cum Missamm reperiretur liber¹; factae sponsionis Turonenses prope
poenituit, detrectantes inventum Missale Columbae poscenti consignare, 111511Πο priori
beneficio alteram adhuc adderet gratiam, et Turonensi Ecelesiae administrandae aliquem

quam vir Sanctus annuerat, et Sanctum fflis Mochonnam velut jam antea a summo
Pontifice pro Turonensi sede destinatum, praesentarat, assecutus est desideratum B.
Martini librum’⁷¹¹¹.

Now, though it is very uniikely that St. Columba ever travelled beyond the British
Islands, the above legend is interesting as an indication of the early connexion which
existed between [relaud and the church of Tours. St. Martin is represented as St.
Patrick's grand-uncle, and as a prineipal agent in his mission to Ireland. In the next
age, his body is reported to have been discovered by the great monastic patron of Ire-
land, and his n'tua] transferred from Tours to Derry. And 111 later times the holy wells
of Derry, called δοῦσι] moricum, 1:0pr (Ζίὸοῐὴηωη, and cobop Cotuun, preserved
the local association of his name with those of the fathers of the Columbian ordern.

¹ Missurum Liba—It is called a ΓοῐΓοθῑο, or
φθερεῖ, 111 other authorities, but the British and
Irish extended 1110 term 10 a formulary containing
poi-tiens of the Gospel read in Divine Service. Thus
in St. Caidoc's Life we find ¹¹ Cum beatus Gildas in
insula Echni Deo ministeriis mancipatus degeret,
missalem librum scripsit⁷ illumque sancto Cadoco
obtulit, quum illius Confessor extitit, ideoque codex
ine Evangelium Gildae vocatur.''—Rees, Cambro-

Brit. SS. p. 66. The vague acceptation of the term
appears in the gloss on tho Felire, at St. Finnian's
day, as translated by Colgan : ‘² Ferunt quod Fin-
nianus de Magbili tulerit libros Legis Moysaicae
primo ad Hiberniam, si hoc verum : vel per Libros
Legis intelliguntur Evangelia.'‘-Acta Sanctorum,
p. 643 a.
