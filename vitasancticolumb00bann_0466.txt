Ex-
Adamnan makes

frequent mention of the abbot‘s domus (22 3, 226), or hospitium (239), or
hospitiolum (2 26, 2 3 3), which he styles a tuqurmm (2 3 3), or tuquriolum (54, 65, 125,
215), at some distance from the others (226), built with joistsu (54), and situate 011 an
eminence (227). Here the founder sat and wrote (125, 143, 215), 01 read (163), har-

term to one volume embracing several books, which
afterwards came into general use (see Maitlaud'sDark
Ages, p. 194, Lond. 18 5 3), as for instance in Scot-
land. where the little library 01· St. Servanus's isle,
-011 Lochleven, numbered among its 16 volumes a
pars Bibliothecae, or ‘portion of aBib1e‚’ a term not
so vague as might be supposed (Reg. Priorat. S. An-
drem. Pref. p. xxx). The Irish acceptation of the
word was still rnore limited, and they applied it to
the case or cover osa sinyle book, and, secondly,t0any
rasa. “ Assicus sanctus episcopus faber aereus erat
Patricio, et faciebat altaria, bihliothicas, quas fa-
cieba[n]t in patinos sancti nostri pro honore Patri-
cii episcopi, et (10 illis .iiii. patinos quadratos vidiu
(Lib. Annae. fol. 1 1 bb). Again. ¹· Fons vero
quadratus fuit, et petra quadrata erat in ore fontis,
et veniebat aqua super pet-ram, id est, per glutina-
tiones, quasi vestigium regale, 01 dixerunt increduli
quod quidam profeta mortuus fecit bibliothicam sibi
in aqua sub petra ut dealbaret ossa sua'' (ib. fol.
¹3 bb). In the short charter of 1004 enteredin this
manuscript, we find “ Sic reperi in bibliothicis Scoto-
rum'¹ (sol. 16 bb). St. Dega's Life gives an enume-
ration of his works‚ namely, campanas, cymbala,
baculos. ,01110οΞ, scrinia, capsas, pyxides, calices, dis-
cos, altariola, chrysmalia, [Ihm-umque coopertoria,
quaedam vero alia auro atque argento, gemmisque
pretiosis, circumtecta.” (Act. SS. Aug. tom. 111,
p. 659 a.) Elsewhere 111 1110 same Life we have the
Latin equivalent for the Greek compound: ⁴⁴ Evan-
gelium etiam optimum postremo scripsit, necnon
repositarium ad idem recondendum mirabiliter con-
struxit.'’ (lb. p. 659 b.)

1 Plateam-The Irish term puiece denotes ‘a
green,' ι11001111,1 01 the entrenehed space attached

to an earthen fort. Faheeran in the King's County
is pmcce Cinnam, platea Kiarani (Four Mast.
1547). Cormac's Glossary translates peuce! by
platea, voc. pul. (Ir. Nennius, p. 93.)

Υ ΒοΗια.-Τ110 Irish Life applies this term to the
cells in St. Mobi's monastery of Glasnevin.

⁵ Cellae.-St. Cainnech was on one occasion in
Hy, and when the bell rang for nona the abbot was
missing, and ¹¹ per omnes cellas ab omnibus fratribus
diligenter quaerebatur.” Vit. e. 22 (p. 40, ed„ Orm.)
Colgan's Ter-t. Vit. speaks of the abbot's cella, c. 34
(Tr, Th. p. 329 b).

2 Collum—The Sec. νὴ. in {tolgan has “tunc
omnes fratres de suis advenientes cellulis, cap. 19
(Tr. Th. p. 327 α). Bede's description 01· St. Cuth-
bert’s monastery where there were only oratorium
and habitaculum commune (H. E. iv. 28), was of a
different character: but his account of the casce and
domuncula? of Coldingham (H. E. iv. 25) applies to
1110 monastery of Hy. Iu fact the Irish monaster-ies
seem to have been modelled very much after the
eastern pattern, such as Adamnau describes of the
monastery of Mount Thabor: ¹* Cujus in medio
campo monachorum inest grande monasterium, et
pluriinae eorumdem cellulae.'' And again, “Supra
memorati monasterii et trium ecclesiarum aedifieia
cum cellulis monachorum, lapideo omnia circumve-
niuntur muro”—i.i. 27 (Mabill. Act. SS. Ord. Ben.
saec. iii. pt. ii. p. 467). Cassula is used for cellula
in the Book of Armagh (fol. 5 ba, 10 aa).

υ hina—Probably two stories high. Adamnan,
describing 1110 abodes os the Egyptians in the fiooded
plains of the Nile, says, “in domibus transversis
tabulis suffultis, aquas supra iuhabitant.'’ De Loci
Sanctis, ii. 30.
