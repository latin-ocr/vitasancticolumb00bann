b (jamniam-This famous saint, of whom
frequent mention is made by Adamnan‚ was
born in 517, and died in 600. He was a native
of Keenaght, in the county of Londonderry, in
which barony his principa! northern chureh,
called Drumachose, was sstuated, where for
many centuries his memory was specially vene-
rated, and the superior of which was styled ‘ the
Coarb of Cainnech in Cianacht.’ See Reeves'
Colton's Visit. pp. 25, 39, 132; Eccles. Ant. p.
374. For his descent see the note on Cainne-
clius Mocu Dolon, iii. 17, infra. His principal
churches in the south were Aghaboe, on which
see next note, and the two Kilkennys, on which
see note ἲ), i. 4 (p. 28) supra. ln Scotland he is
generally called Kenneth; and Kilkenneth, or
Kilebenzie, is a common name of churches in
Argyleshire and the western Islands. His fes-
tival, both in Ircland and Scotland, is October
1 1. There are six lessons at his festival in the
Breviary of Aberdeen, intituled, ⁴* Sancti cay-
nici abbatis quiin Kennoquhy in diocesi sancti
andree pro patrono habetur? The church
here mentioned is Kennoway in Fife.

⁶ Aclzed-bou.—-Now Aghaboe, a parish in the
Queen's County, and diocese of Ossory. The
site and lands of the monastery were granted
to St. Cainnech by his patron, Colman, son of
Feradach, King of Ossory. See note ὃ, i. 11

Aghaboe subsequently became the episcopal
seat os Ossory: “Anno Domini meu. [recte
mecm] obiit reverendus pater Felix Odullane
episcopus Ossoriensis; cujus ecclesia cathe-
dralis tunc erat apud Aghboo in superiori
Ossoria.''-—-Ussher‚ Brit. Ee. Ant. c. 17 (Wks.
vi. p.526). Before ¹250 the cathedralwas trans-
ferred to Kilkenny [Ciu Cainnifih, ‘Cainnech's
church']‚ where was an ancient religious esta-
blishmcnt, of which the Round Tower still
remains an evidence. See Harris' Ware's
Works, vol. i. pp. 399, 403, 406; Archdall's
Monasticon Hib. p. 588. In the Taxations
contained in the Red Book of Ossory, Aghaboe
is the head of a Rural Deanery (fol. 21, 24).
A very interesting memoir os Aghaboe. com-
piled about 1793. by Dr. Edward Ledwich, then
incumbent of the parish, appears in Mason's
Parochial Survey of Ireland (vol. i. pp. 13-78);
in which work it is stated that reprints of Led-
wich's account of Aghaboe, and Sir John Sin-
clair's account of Thurso (Old Stat. Surv. os
Scotland, vol. xx. p. 493), were circulated
among the clei-gy of Ireland as models sor their
contributions to an Irish Parochial Snrvey. (p.
xii.) On the orthography of the name, see
Zeuss, Gram. Celt. i. p, 67.
