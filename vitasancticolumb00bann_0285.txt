cuin] 50 named from Boetan, great-grandson
of Loarn Mor. Ι Τ119 rural deanry, uhich is
the best evidence of the original extent of the
lordship on which it was modelled, included
the parishes of Kilmartin, Craignish, Kilchat-
tan, Kilbrandon, Kilmelsord, Kilninver‚ Kil-
bride, Kilmore‚ Kilchrenan, 1111511311, Muckairn,
Glenorchy, Ardebattan‚ Lismore, and Appiu,
that 15, the portion of the present county of
Argyll lying north and west ot* Loch Awe, ex-
tending to Loeh Levcn on the north, and the
Crinan Canal on the south-west. See Innes,
Orig. Par. ii. 1, pp. 91-159. The Genus Gab-
rani has been mentioned by Adamnan, cap. 22
(p. 132) supra.

’ί Suineum insulam—Now Slzmza, an island
in the parish of Kilchattan, lying close to
Luing 011 the east, and separated from it by the
Sound of Shuna. Itis situate 111 Nether Lorne,
near its southern extremity. The contrary
wind which delayed them there was probably a
north-west one, but they were in sai'cty 011 the
sheltered side of Luing. Fordun writes the
name szay⁴¹ (Scotiehr. ii. ιο.) There is another
Shuna off Appin, 011 the north of Lismore, but
it 15 too far up to suit the present description;
still more so is Shona, off Moydart.

¹Festiva noan—The choice between 596 and
597, as the year ofSt. Columba's death, depends,
Abp. Ussher says, upon the determination of
the question, “num nox illa media, qua Co-
lumba decessisse diximus, diem Junii 1101111111

Η submergunt Boll.

vel inchoaverit vel finierit.'' (Wks. vi. p. 235)
The present expression favour-s inrlzuaverit,
and thus indicates the latter year.

¹¹¹ A Domino impetrare-The following chap-
ter 1135, “orante pro nobis nostro venerabili
patrono.'' In i. 1 (p. ¹3) snpra, he speaks of the
Saint as a ‘⁴ victorialis et fortissimus propug-
nator.“ The existence osa belief in the minis-
tration and intercessioni os deceased saints in
temporal matters is clearly indicated in the
three concluding chapter-s os this book. St.
Columba was invoked, cluriny his lzfitime, from
remote places. See ii. 5 (p. 112), 13 (p. 122),
39 (p. 161), 40 (163), supro.

¹² In mare proqredimnr.—-That 15, by rowiug.
P1·esently,0n getting clear ofthe islands, “nau-
tae vela subrigunt.'’

⁰ Notus.—Shuna lies E. S. E. of Hy.

ν Post horam tertiam—They were within a
sortnight of the longest day; and ifthey started
at three in the morning, diluculo nume, the
Journey might have been accomplished in six
hours: that is, supposing them to have arrived
at nine. But the present expression allows a
longer time, for it only asserts that the cano-
nical “tertia hora” was past.

‘1 Portum insula—See note ὓ, i. 30 (p. 58)
supra. 1f they chose to disembark at the
nearest lauding-placs›‚ Port-a-churaich was
the one which they would choose. See Alap.
