Thus we find St. Columba directly or indirectly concerned in three battles, the earliest
of which occurred the year but one before his retirement to Britain, aud the others at
later periode, one of them after he had been twenty-four years in the abbacy of Hy.
The first his biographers and panegyrists aclmowlcdge to have been the grand error of
his h‘fe, for which he paid the penalty of pilgrimage3 but to save 1115 character after
he became the apostle of the Northern Picts, and the refigious exemplar of the Albanian
Soots, the device is resorted to of antedating the other commences in which the 111111ῃὲ-
of his nature betrayed itself; and whereas his partieipation 111 111050 evils could not be
denied, it was thrust back into the irresponsible part of his life, rather than allow it to
be numbercd among the acts of his maturity. That Columba, closely allied to the
principale in these deeds of strife, ancl within one step himself of the object they were·
oontending for, should look on with indifference, is not to be expected,—cspecially in
an age of revolution, and among a people whose constitution and natioual construction
rendered civil fection almost inscparable from their existence. It was not until 804,
that the monastic 00111111111111105 of Ireland were for-mally exempted from militm-y ser-
vice; and the endeavours of Fothndh¹ the Canonist, in proeming this enac-tinent from
Aedh Oirdnidhe, the monarch of Ireland, form the subject of panegyric and special
mention in the Annals. That, even among themselves, the membcrs of powerful coma
munities were not insensible to 1110 spirit of faction, appears from numerous enti-ies in
the ancient Annalsr. Of these, two-of which one relates to a Columbian house—may
here be adduced as examples: A.D. 763, ‘⁴ A battle was fought at Argamoyn between
the fiaternities of Clonmaenois and Durrow, where Del-mod Duff, son of Donnell, was
killed, and. Diglac, son of Dubh'ss, with 200 men of the fraternity of Dmrow. Bresal,
son of Murchadh, with the fraternity of Clonmaenois, was victor.’' Δ»1.1). 816, “ A
battle was fought by cathal, son of Dunlang, and the fraternity of Tigh-Muuna
[Taghmon] against the fraternity of Ferns, in which 400 were slain. 1110011111111, 5011 of
Oennfaeladh, abbot of Raphoe‚ of the fraternity of Colum-cille, was elain. The 110101-
nity of Colum-cille went to Tara to curse [king] Ae(lh.⁷' The same principle which
caused St. Columba‘s panegyrists to represent his battlos as delinquencies of his youth,
operated with the Fom- Mastcrs, when compffing their comprehensive Anuals from
earlier authorities, 111 dealing with these oft-recurring monastic encounters, and as
there was no opening for a transfer of the blame, they &appi-esee& the mention of- them.
