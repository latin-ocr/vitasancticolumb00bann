An. Ult. relate the occurrence more succinctly⁷
but in the exact form of the text: A. C. 636,
Bellum Roth. An ancient historical romanoe,
called The Batele osMayIz Rath, was published
in the original 1rish, with a translation and
notes, sor the Irish Archaeological Society, in
1842, by Professor O'Donovan. This curious
tale, while it contains many statements that are
inaccurate, seems in its main features to have
been founded upon fact, and supplies the infor-
mation which is required to identify the ac-
counts ofAdamnan and the Annals. It states
that Congal Claen, the prime mover of the ex-
pedition, was maternal grandson of Eochaidh
Buidhe, and consequently that Domhnall Breac
was his uncle. Thu, flying to Alba, he pre-
sented himself at his grandfather’s court of
Dun Monaidh (p. 46), at Sliabh Monaidh (p. 56).
Which place is identified by some with Dun-
staffnage (Battle of Magh Rath, p. 4⁶³ Irish
Nennius, p. 285), but on insufficient grounds.
Edinburgh is called Dun Monaidlae on the title
ofBishop Carsewell's Psalms. (See also TranS.
Gael. Soc. p. 118.) The following summary
of the tale is given by Charles O'Conor of
Belanagare: ‘¹ Domnall, son of Aodh, the son
of Ainmirey, ascended the throne, and began
his administrativa with an act of extreme jus-
tice; that of taking vengeance on the mur-
derer of his predecessor. Congal Claon he
defeated in the battle of Duukehern (see p.
95, supra), and obliged him to fiy into Britain.
Congal Claon remained nine years in exile.
Saxons, Britons‚ Albanian Scots, and Picts
flocked to his standard. His domestic par-
tizans prepared for his reception, and he landed
safely on the coast of Down. Domnall, king
of Ireland, was not unprepared. He imme-

diately encamped near the enemy at Moyrath,
and began as bloody a battle as can be found
iu the records of that age: it continued with
various success sor six whole days, until vic—
tory declared for the nation on the seventh.
Congal ciaon, the soul of the enemies’ army,
was defeated and slain at the head ofthe troops
of Ulad. The foreign troops were soon broke
with great slaughter ς and Domnal Breac, King
of the Albanian Scots, hardly escaped to Bri—
tain, with the sorry remains of a fine army,
which should be employed for the defence os the
people he so wantonly attacked-‘'-Dissert. on
Hist. of lreland, p. 210 (Dubl. 1812). Fordun,
who notices this prophecy, represents AEdan
as acting “contra B. Columbae monita‚'' and
paying the penalty in defeat (Scotichr. iii. 27);
but he omits to notice the real drift os the al-
leged prediction. Magh Rath is supposed tn
be the modern Moira, a well-known village and
parish in the county of Down; but as the iden-
tifieation is based upon the name alone, the
existence of other places in the county of Down
similarly called, renders the supposition doubt-
ful: especially as the chief clue given in the tale
leads to the neighbourhood of Newry (pp. 274v
276). The places mentioned in connexion with
the battle, Mayh-comair (pp. 1 10. 227), Tulchau-
na-dtaillyeann (p. 119), Daire-z'n-latha. Carn
Conyail (p. 174), Ανά-ηα-Ιιίπιαίνεεί (p. 180),
Cnocan-an-choscair (p. 216), and Atlz-an-oruaimll
(p. 226), will probably determine the situation.
