extremam senectutem conservantem, priusquam moriatur, opportune bap-
tizemus. Et, haec dicens, sanetus senex in quantum potuit comites festinus
praecedebat, donee in illum devenit agrum ⁶qui ⁷Airehart-dan‘1 enuncupatur:
ibidemque quidam repertus senex, ⁹Emehatus⁰ nomine, audiens a Sancto
verbum Dei praedicatum, et credens, baptizatus est, 10et continuo, laetus et
securus, cum angelis obviantibus ei, ad Dominum commigravit. Sed et filius
ejus ¹¹Virolecus eredens cum tota domo est ¹²baptizatus.

ἀ Airclzart-dan.-Now Glen Urquhart, on the
west side of Loeh Ness. Glen-aroclzdan is the
local pronunciation of the name. lt is said
that at Templehouse, in the entrance of the
glen, there was formerly a chureh, at a spot
marked by a large ash-tree, and that the ee-
metery occupied the space now crossed by the
road. There are the remains of other ancient
cemeteries 'm the glen, called Killmeechal, Kil-
lyeenan, and Croch-an-boora. This Urquhart
is not to be confounded with the Urquhard
mentioned in St. Malrubius· lections in the Bre-
viary of Aberdeen (Part. Estiv. fol. 90 α b) ς
*the latter is the same as Ferintosh in the Black
Isle in Rosshire, where St. Maree’s memory is
still preserved.

ἓ Emclzatus.-.Probably the same as the Irish
name lmcbuoh.

⁸ Monasterii rotundi.-—Dr. Petrie supposes,
with some reason, that the building here re-
ferred to was an ecclesiastical Round Tower,
and observes: “We have, at least, one histo-
rical authority which, to my mind, satisfactorily

proves the erection of a Round Tower in the
sixth eenturystfflound Towers, p. 382.) See the
note on Illaynce domus, next page. The learned
writer, however, makes some mistakes regard-
ing the copies of Adamnau. If he had ever
seen Cod. Β., the exemplar which Pinkerton
professes to follow, he would not have called it
‘¹ aMS. ofthe twelfth century :''fifteenll1 is more
likely to be the date. Speaking of the printed
editions, he observes, “that the important head-
ing prefixed to this chapter is not found in that
os the Bollandists; but it is found in the better
edition of Colgan, which is taken from an au-
eient vellum manuscript, preserved at Augia
(ΑΗΚ), iu Germany.” (lb. p. 383.) The Bol-
landist editor has printed it at p. 227 h.num.15,
only not in situ. Colgan and the Bollandists
followed the same exemplar, and employed the
same transcript of it, namely, that made by
Stephen White: and, consequently‚ their errors
and omissions proceed pari passu, except where
either ventures to emend on his own indivi-
dual authority. Their exemplar is our Cod. A„
