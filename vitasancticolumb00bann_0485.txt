Hy, by which we may understand, either that he was appointed, in consequence ot* the age or
infirmity of Conamhail, to administer the affairs of the society, as 8 tanist abbae, or that some
schism in the community‚ possibly on the Pascha] question (for Dunchadh proved a reformet in
716) led to 8 rival appointment. See O'Comr’s note in Rer. Hib. Script. vol. iv. p. 72.

Son ofCennfaeladh. Called Duunchadus by Bede (H. E. v. 22). He was ot* the most noble
branch of the house ot* 0011811 Gulban, for his grandfather Maelcobha, who died in 615, was the
third ot* the family who were successively monarchs of Ireland, and his grand-uncle Domhnall,
who won the battle of Magh Rath (200) in 6 37, sncceeded Maelcobha ou the throne. During
his presidency there seems to have been a schism in the community, for in 713 and 716, two
other members of the ordor were elected to the cathedra Ine or Columba» : or it may be that 8
different office, such 85 prior, or even bislaeop, is denoted by the expression. On the death of
Conamail, he succeeded to the vacant abbacy, and it was not till 713 that Dorbene was
appointed to the chair- .· who died in the same year. The next election to the chair was in 716,
and Faelcu, son of Dorbene, who was then chosen, ontlived him, and succeeded him in the full
enjoyment of the abbacy. It was under this abbot that the Columbian monks conformed to the
Roman Easter and Tonsure. The last occasion on which the old Easter was observed was at the
festiva] of 715, aster a duration of 150 years (Bede, H. Ε. iii. 4). The change was efl'ected
through the exertions osa Nortliumbrian priest, called Ecgberct⁷ “ qui in Hibernia diutius exul-
averat pro Christo, eratque et doctissimus in scripturis et longae vitae perfectione eximius'⁷ (ib).

diverted from his purpose by 8 vision, in which his former master Boisil appeared to him, and de-
clared that ‘⁸ Dei voluntatis est ut ad Columbae monasteria magis pergat docenda” (v. 9). Accord-

obstacles to the unity was removed, an opportunity offered for the acconiplishment osa work in
