St. Columba's death. the occurrence of the
night was commemorated on the following
day. Thus Ιιαε in nocte in cap. 12, infra.

²¹ Mocu Loiqse.—-That is, mac U ῑοῐδΓθ,
filius Nepotunz Lozyisi. Loigsech or Laeigh-
seach Cenn-mor was the son of Conal] Cer-
nach, a famous hero of the first century; his
son, Lughaidh Laeighseach, obtained from the
then king of Leinster a tract in that province,
iu which he settled, and which received from his
descendants the name of Laiqlzis, afterwards
called Leix. That territory is now repre-
sented by the four central bai-onies of the
Queen's County, and the ancient name is pre-
served in the compoundAhbeyleix, a parish sit-
uate therein. Oennu, second abbot of Clon-
macnois, who was ofthe same race, is designated
mac huo Loiffire in Tighernach, An. 570, and
the Calendars at Jan. 20. See the note on Co-
lumbanus‚ next page. Concerning the terri-
torial Laeighis‚ see O’Flaherty‚ Ogyg. p. 293;
Book of ffights, p. 215.

b calceantes—See ii. 13 (pp. 122, 123) supra.
In the Irish Lives we often meet with the
words fico, and subtalaris or sotularis, instead
of calceus.

⁰ Adjectionem fieri.—From this passage we
learn that Sundays and other holidays were
marked at Hy by rest from labour, celebration
of the Bochai-ist, and improved diet.

d Hac in nocta—According to our mode of
speaking he would have said nocte proeterita.
See note ¹, i. 45 (p. 181), note θ, cap.11 (p. 210),
supra.

e Celebrare mysteria—See note ἃ, on preced-
ing chapter.

sAlbati..-The reading in Colgan and the
Bollandists is absurd, for sabbatum, which in
Adamuan and other authors until modern times
always signifies Saturday‚ was a dies solemnis
only among Jews. So albatis induti vestibus,
cap. 16 : albatorum millium, cap. 23, ιή ra.

[1 consueta deponentia—This was a prayer,
‘¹ pro animabus defunctorum,” among which St.
Columba now introduceda fresh name, directing
the choristers pro sancto Columbaria episcopo
decantare.

¹¹ Martini nomem-In the ancient Gallican
Liturgy, which seems to have been closely fol-
lowed by the Irish, it was usual for the priest,
after he had placed the oblation on the altar,
to say the prayer, “Veni Sanctificator Omni·
potens AEterne Deus, et benedic hoc sacrificium
tuo nomini praeparatum, per ChristumDominum
nostrum.'' This was followed by the recita]
from the diptychs of the saints* names, both
deceased and living, in whose memory, or for
whom, the offer-ing was made. The nature of
this commemoration we learn from the form
prescribed by St. Aurelianus sor the church os
