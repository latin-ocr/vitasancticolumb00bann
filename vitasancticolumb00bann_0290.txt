Chai-les O'Conor, senior, had a copy of “this
poem in a very obscure character” (O'Con.
Ber. Hib. SS. iv. p. ¹29³ Stowe Catal. i. p. 95);
and other ancient copies are mentioned by'
O'Reilly (Irish Writ. p. 48). The original has
been printed in Hardiman's Irish Miustrelsy,
vol. ii. p. 372; aliteral translation, by DnO’Do-
novau‚ in theDublinPenny Journal(vol. i. p. 94)3
and a metrical one by the late J. C, Mangan.
His sur-name Fina was derived from his mother,
and thus he is distinguished from picum Ριηη,
an ecclesiastic, whom the Gloss on the Felire
of AEngus at Jan. 14 places at Inbher Neola
[ou sseobto ¹ ol'the Foyle'?] onthe confines ofTir
Connell and Tir Eoghain3 or at Chuillinn be-
side Corcagh, as Marian Gorman at same day3
as well as from Flann Finn, a chier of the Cinel
Eoghain in 698, whom the An. Ult. call Flann
Albus (An. 699). Pinkerton greatly errs in
eonfounding this Aldfrid with Alchfrid, a legi-
timate son of Oswy‚ who was invested with
regal power by his father, but died at an ear-
lier (late. T. Innes endeavours to make it
appear that Aldfrid's place of retirement was
Ycolmkilh and draws the startling conclusion:
“We see that it was usual to the exactest
writers to confound Scotland with Ireland in
these times, when the natue Scotia, and, as ap-

pears by this passage of Malmesbury and others,
even the name Hibernia was common to both.”
(Civ. Eccl. Hist. p. 278.) Goodall finishes the
climax: “per illas insulas minime Hibernia,
literis nunquam celebris, sed Hebrides, et ex eis
flii vel Iona insula praecipue designari vide-
tui-'J' (Fon-dun, vol. i. p. 159, note 4.) Fordun
was less exclusive: ‘⁶ Qui non paucis annis in
Scotia et Hibernia discendo literas euram de-
dit.“ (Scotichr. iii. 51.)

Nechtain of the Annalists is supposed to be the
modern Dunfflchen, a parish in Forfarshire,
next Forfar, on the south-east, and which is
mentioned as Dunnechlyn in a char-ter of Wil-
liatn the Lion to the abbey of Arbroath. (Liber
de Aberbmthoe, pp. 4, 10, 124, 165.) The
Saxon Chronicle places the scene of aetion
near the Norelz Sea (An. 685), to which the
situation of Dunnichen answers, as it is only
twelve miles distant from the German Ocean.
