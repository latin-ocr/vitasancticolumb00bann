6 Vita Sancti Columboe [ρης. ιι.

in the Irish calendar so called. Itis observable
that in continental hagiology Columba is a fe-
male appellation; whereas, among the Irish,
with one or two trifling exceptions, it belongs
to the opposite sex. We have in Adamnan
various Latin forms of the name, as Columba,
Columbanus, Columbus, and Columb. The
first bishop of Dunkeld was Columba, who
flourished about 640.

iDivitiae ninum-Pron xxii. 1. The quota-
tion agrees with the Vulgate. lts application
of nomen is peculiar.

’ἰ Α diebus infantioe.—This shows that Colum-
ba was an original name. Irish writers pretend
that he was christened Crimtlzann (emor'neunn
‘a fox'), but that his playmates designated
him Columba on account of his gentleness. lt
may have been that he had two names, ono
baptismal and the other secular‚ as in the case
of Fintan or Munna, Fintan or Berach, Cro·
nan or Mochua, Carthach or M ochuda, Darerca
or Monenna, in the Iris'h calendar; Munghu
or Kentigern in the Scotch; Cadoc or Cath-
mael in the British; Nuallohc or Cuthbert in
the Saxon. It is a curious coincidence that a
distinguished contemporary of our saint was
Columba son of Crimthann. See the first note
on ii. 36, inf.

¹Filius repromissionis.—‘⁴ Terra repromis-
sionis“ is a common name in the lives of Irish
saints for the Holy Land.

³¹ ΡνορΙιεἰ(ιει“οηε.--Τ1]ἰι“ῐ51 γεω-5, and its mul-

tiples, were the term which the Irish legends
generally allowed sor the fulfilment of such
predictions. St. Patriek prophesied the birth
of S. David and S. Kieran 30 years before (Tr.
Th. p. 208); of S. ComgaH, S. Molash‚ S. Col-
man, S. Mac Nisse, 60 years beforehand (lb.
pp. 88; 209 [13 Act. SS. Jun. Sep. i. p. 664);
of S. Ciaran and S. Brendan, 120 years in ad-
vance (Tr. Th. pp. ¹45 h,- 158). The life os
S. Columba in the Cod. Salmant. expressl)⁷
limits this prophecy to 60 years. (Tr. Th. p.
325-)

“¹ Proselytus.-Gr. προσῆλυτος, advena, pere-
qrinus, qui aliunde venit. See the examples of
the term ati. 26, 30, 32, 44 infra.

υ Patricii episcopi.—Cummian‚ in his Paschal
epistle¹ written circ. 634, calls him “sanctus
Patricius papa noster.·*—(Ussher‚ Syll. Ep. xi.)
He is mentioned in Vcn. Bede’s Martyrology at
Mar. 17. His Hymn by Seaehnall is preserved
in manuscripts of the eighth century. His
Confession in the Book ol'Armagh was tran-
scribed, about the year 800, from his autograph‚
then partly illegible; yet Ryves and Ledwich
called his existence in question; and a chival-
rous German has lately asserted “ficta sunt
quae Patricii seruntur scripta. Falsa quae Vitis
traduntur. Incertum est vel Prosperi testimo—
nium.''—C. G. Scheell, Eccl. Brit. Scotorumque
Hist. Font. p. 77 (Berol. ¹851).

Ρ Maucteus.—St. Mochta of Lughmagh, or
Louth, is commemorated iu the Calendars at
