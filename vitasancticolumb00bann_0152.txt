This tribe name is applied to St. Fiutan in
cbap. 2 supra (p. m).

³ Beraclms.-Colgan supposes that this was
St. Bemeh, founder of Cluain-Choirpthe‚ or
Kilbarry, but on the very insufficient grounds
that a disputo in which he was engaged was
referred to Aidan son of Gabhran, who endea-
voured, but unsuccessfully⁷ to detain the saint
in Scotland. (Act. SS. p. 342 α; Tr. Th. p.
377 ιι, 11. 61.) Berach, an abbot of Bangor,
died in 663. Colgan interprets the name ‘⁴ di-
recte et punctualiter ad scopum collimans, vel
quasi alicujus mucrone punctum attingens.''—-
(Aet. SS. p. 346 a, n. 2.)

¹³ Ermum—This word is not a substantive,
as has been generally supposed: for further on
we find Ethici pelayi; bnt an adjective agree-
ing with insula (twice in this chap„ and iii. 8),
or terra (once in this chap.‚ aud i. 36, ii. 15
twice, 39, iii. 8). Itis an appellative formed
from ech or ich, ⁵ corn‚' and signifies triticise-
rat, the island being, as Fordun describes it,
“insula ubi hordei magna copia? or, as it is
termed in a Gaelie poem, Cm ηηοῑ noh-opnn.
‘the low-lying land of barley.' It is men-
tioned in the Lives of several Irish saints as

terra, insula, or reyzb, Hyffl, or Hitl1; and from
Cin reu, the Irish compound answering to
Terra Heth, was formed the proper name,
which has passed through the various stages of
Tirieth (Reginam of Durham, 12th cent.).
Tyre—f} (Fordun, ii. 1ο), Tyriad (1343), Tereyd
(1354), Tyriaye (1390), Tierez'y (1496). until it
has been reduced to its present form of Tiree.
The island Tiree is about eleven miles long,
and varies in breadth from one to three. It is
a low sandy tract. lying about twenty miles
N.W. of Hy. Artchain (i. 36 infra), and Cam-
pus Lunye (i. 30, 41, ii. 15, 39, iii. 8), were si-
tuated in the Ethica terra. See the paper on
“ the Island of 'l'iree'' in the Ulster Journal os
Archaeol. ii. pp. 233-2443 lones· Orig. Paroch„
under Soroby and Kirkapoll (vol. ii. pt. 1, pp.
327-331-)

Β Insulas—The direct course to Tiree lies in
the open sea: the circuitous route would lead
northwards to Staffa, thence to the Treshnish
13195, and from them westwards to the northern
extremity of the island.

‘¹ Spatia pelagi.—lt is nearly twenty miles
across from Hy to Port—na-lung beside Soroby
in Tiree. Observe the form Ethici pclayi.
