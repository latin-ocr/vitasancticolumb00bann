shrine, contributcd to defeat its own object in the end, and subjected the shrine to the
fate from which its fellow, the Great Gospel of Kells, had so narrow an escape-the
shell abstracted, and the substance cast away.

It is further to be obser-ved, that the venerafion for St. Oolumba’s remains was
not confincd to Ireland and Scotland ε the cathedral of Durham also claimed to be the
depository of at least a portion of his relies. This appears from a catalogue of the re-
lies at Durhnm, written in the fourteenth century, in which we find the entry: ‘¹ De
ossibus et reliquiis Sancti Columkclli abbatis''³. A representation of the saint was
painted also on the screcn-work of the altar of St. Jerome and St. Bencdict, in the
smne church, with the‘ inscription, ‘⁴ Sanctus Columba monachus et abbas'’¹².

IN connexion with the history of Columkill's remains, the antiquary may desire to
have a catalogue of those articles which tradition investecl with the repute of having
boon esteemed or used by the saint. Adamnan makes mention of a Hymnal, which
was preserved in I1·eland⁰; and of aWhite Pebble, which was used as a chal-m among
the Piets<¹; also of Books written by him, and the white Tunic hc wore at the time of
his death, which were preserved in Hye. Some of these were afterwards lost, but later
writings have. furnished us with the names of others which do more than supply their
place. Thus, among the alleged compositions of St. Columba contained in the Laud
MSf, is a poem in the form of a dialogue between him and Baithen'c Morg, son os
Cunna, 011 the subject of his chief reliques, to wit, the Great Oros-s, the C'athaelz, and
his Cowl. Resides these, there were others of lesser note, which wil] presently be
noticed.
