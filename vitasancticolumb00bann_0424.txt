Cathbarr Q'Donncll, son of Gillachrist [ob. 1038], son of Cathbarr, son of Domhnall
Mor, the progenitor of the O’Donnell's, was chief of the Cinel Luighdech⁰‚ and died in
1 106. Domhnall Mac Robhartaighp, successor of Columba at Kells, died, according to
the Four Masters, in 1098. His name occurs also in the charters which are entered
in the blank pagos of the Book of Kellsq. Sitric was son of Mac AEdha, who was sur-
named Cerci, that is, ‘Astifioerss in the Chartcrs of Kells, where mention is made of
Fland mac Mic Aedha also. The family of Mac Acdha¹ seem to have been the here-
ditary mechanics of Kells. It is interesting to observo the relation here recorded as
subsistiug, through the Columbian system, between remote parts of Ireland: O'Don-
nell being lord of a territory in the extreme north of the island, yet associated with
the abbot of a midland monastery; and that abbot the member of a family which also
was scatcd in the remote north⁵‚ supplying hcrenachs to two churches in St. Columba’s
region of Theommss, and occasionally appearing in the administration of St. Columba's
church of Derry. In 1497 the Cathaeh was employed for military purposOS, but failed
of procuring victory for its possessors. Con O'Donnell led an army into Moylurg in
Connaught, to attack Mac Dermott, but was defeated at the battle of Bcalach-buidhe.
Mac Robhartaigh, the keepcr [moop] of the Cathach of Columcille, was slain, and the
Cathaeh taken from the Tirconallians. Two years after, it was restored—(Pom Mas-
ters.) 111 the early part of the sixteenth century it was still the great reliquary of
Tirconnell ς and in the following century it continued to bc in the c'ustody of the
family of Mac Robhaiiaigh, tho official kecpers under the Lord of Tirconncll. When
it reappears in the next century, it is fmmd in the possession of the head of the O'Don-
nell family, who recorded his guardianship in an inscription* on the silver frame which
hc made for its preservation ; ΙΑοοΒο 3. n. 11. REGE mmmm, mmm o nomn n<

0 Cinel Luiyhdech.—A tribe of the Cinel Conaill,
who occupied the present barony of Kilmacrenan.
See p. ¹9²⁷ snpra. At ¹¹²9⁷ the Four Masters re-
cord that “the house of Columcille at Cin-mic-
Nenain was taken by Ua Tali-ebert, from Aedh, son
of Cathbarr Ua Domhnaill, and it was burned over
him.'' The O'Dounens were at first only chiefs of
Cinel Luighdech. but they afterwards rose to be
lords of Tirconneu. It was probably on their rise
that the story contained in 1110 Leabhar Breac (fol.
108 b) was written, of which the following is an
extract: on up oocho num &octat otocnc pm

scriptiou, but enough remains to identify it with
that in the charters of the Book of Kells.

sNorth—A portion of this family, whom the
Columbian connexion with Kells brought to Meath,
have descendants still remaining in that county,
who are known by the name O'Rafferty, while the
other branch, which is found in Donegal, is called
O'Roarty. ῃ
