After the commission of an offence, the penitent was required coram omnibus pec-

cantiam suam confiteri (59, 77), generally on his knees (59, 98, 99), and thus, promis-

ing amendment, paenitentiam ayere (98). In such case the abbot either

Panaenum. absolved him on the spot (59), or enjoined a more lengthened discipline,

juxta judicationem (52), which was termed the Zeyes poem'tentz'oe (52, 157),

and sometimes extended to an abode of seven years at a prescribed station (157), some-

times even to twelvc, occasionally aceompanied by sels-mortification, and perpetual

exile from father-lamis (52). The peniteat who fulfilled. the injunction salutem exer-
νιιίί mzz'moe suoe (160).

Th(- Tonsure of the Secundus Ordo, in which the founder was reckoned, was ab aure
acl aurem, that is, the anten'or half of the head was made bare, but the occiput was
untouchedg. This usage existed in St. Patrick's time, who may have found
it in tho country; it was adopted by St. Columba, and continued in his
Order until 718, when the coronal tonsure was received by the society of
Hy‘n This occurred two years after the Pascha] change ; for, though Bede refers the
joint reformation to 716, the practical adoption of a new style of tonsure would require
:1 longer preparation? than a mere ritual obscrvance. The Greek tonsure was totali,
and was stylcd St. Pazol‘s, and the Roman, which was coronal, was stylcd St. Peter’s,
but the Irish fashion, in order to its being brought into disrepute, was opprobriously
ascribed to Simon Mmzcae and when Ceolfrid cast this up to Adamnan, the latter,
instead of repudiating the name, is represented as acquieseing in the reproach, for his apo-
logy was etsi Simonis tonsuram ex consuetudine patria habeam¹. Another scandal circu-
1111οᾱ against it was of its introduction into Ircland by the swine-herd'¹¹ of Laeghaire,

musar-a.

sFaeher-land.—Like patria, the old Irish word
is (lemma, from neuin, pater. St. Columba is
extolled in his Irish Life for abandoning his atharda.

—' &touched-Iu fronte ab aure ad aurem, in-
tonso occipitio.—Mabillon, Annal. viii. 3. The Book
of Durrow has a picture of an ecclesiastic 111 a plaid
chasuble⁷ giving a good representation of this tonsure.

rona sapei-familiam lae datur.'’

Ἀ Τυΐαί.-51. Patrick's charioteer was called To-
tus Calvus, in tlic Book of Armagh, which name is
glossa-«J cominu& (fol. 13 bb), and elsewhere is

written Budmailus (fol. 11 ab). Does the name
indicate any peculiarity of religious origin?

¹¹¹ Swinelzerd.—Ussher cites an ancient Cotton
MS„ containing a collection of Irish Canens, for the
following: ⁴⁴ Romani dicunt tonsuram a Simone
Mago sumpsisse initium, cujus tonsura de aure ad
aurem tantum contingebat ; pro excellentia ipsa ma-
yornm tonsura, qua sola frons anterior regi solebat.
Auctorem autern hujus tonsurae in Hibernia subul-
cum regis Loigeri filii Nil extitisse, Patricii sermo
testatur: ex quo Hibernenses pene omnes hanc ton-
suram sumpserunt.”—Ec. ΒΓ. Ant. c. 17 (wks.
vol. vi. p. 490). The Irish word for tonsus is
muel, and one of Laeghaire's Μωρέ was Lucet-macl.
