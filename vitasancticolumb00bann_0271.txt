*³ Brudeo reem—See cap. 33 (p. 146 ), and 35
(p. 150), supra. It appears from the latter that,
aster his eonversion, Brudeus continued till the
end ofhis life to hold St. Columba in the highest
esteem.

ἓ Utendum—This is the name of the Orkney
Islands in Mela and Pliny. The Irish called
them lnnpi hOpc, and the adjacent sea the
inum nOpe, which they regarded as the ex-
treme northern boundary of Britain, the mum
nlehc, or British ChanneL being the southern
(tr. Nennius, p. 30). They were inhabited in
the first century, for Agricola “incognitas ad
id ternpus insulas, quas Orcadas vocant, inve—
nit domuitque. Dispecta est Thule quadam te-
nus‚'’ Sec. (Tacit. Agric. 10.) We may suppose
that the first wave os Celtic population in
Britain extended northwards to them (Ir.
Neu. p. 30). Tradition says the Fir—Galeoin (a
tribe ofthe Firbolgs)‚ and the mets, were suc-
cessively occupants of them: and that thence
a portion of the latter passed over tothe Franks
(171. pp. 48, 50, 52). The Latin Nennius also
states that the Picts, at an early period, occu-
pied the Orcades⁷ c. 12 (p. 9, ed. Stev.); but
elsewhere he speaks ostheisland, ‘⁴ in extremo
limite orbis Brittanniae ultra Pictos, et vocatur
Orc.''—c. 8 (p. 7, ib.) When Hengist offered
the services of Oetha and Ebissa, “ut dimi-
cent contra Scottos,'' they were invited to
Britain, and “cum navigarent contra Pictos,
vastaverunt Orcades insulas.'' (Nennius, c.
38. p. 29, ib.) From which it would appear
that in the fifth century these islands were
possessed by the Picts, whose occupation pro-
bably continued till at least the close of the

sixth century. Chalmers supposes that at the
date referred to in the text the inhabitants
were Seandinavians (Caledon. i. p. 262). See
the judicious remarks in Irish Neunius, p. 1463
and the authorities cited in the following note.

cuil, p. 133 (Par. 1814).

s Cujus obsides.-The Dalriadic· Scots at this
period extended their enterprise as far as these
islands. The An. Ult., at 579, record peche
Ope Lu helenan mio ffiobpom, ‘ an expedition
against the Orkneys by Aedan, son of Gabli-
ran'3 and again at 580. It may be that at
this time a northern colony had established ’
itself in the Orkneys, if we may judge from
Godbold, the name oftheir king. who, according
to Bromptou, fell at the battle of Haethfelth in
633. (Twysden, Hist. Angl. Script. Deo, p. 7 84;
also Galfrid. Monemut. xii. S.) ln 682, Bruidhe
mac Bile⁷ king of the mets, the successful op-
ponent of the Saxons, reduced these islands:
Orcades deletae sunt Lo [per] Bruidlze.—Tigh.
(So An. Ult. 681.) They were again invaded
'm 709: Bellum pop Opocnbh [contra Orc-adas]
in quo filius Artablair jacuit.—An. L'lt. 708.
T. Iunes, in reference to the present passage,
observes: ⁴* By this it appears that the prince-
of the Orkneys was subject and tributary to
the king of the Picts, aud that the Pictish do-
miniohs extended to the utmost bounds of the·
north of Britain and adjacent islands.'' (Civ.
Ecel. Hist. p. 206.) Chalmers, on the other
hand, declares ⁴¹ it is sufficiently apparent that
neither the Picts, nor Scots, had any pretence
of right over the Orkney, and Shetland isles.
The contemporary inhabitants of both were of
a different lineage, as we have seen ς and owed
their obedience to their original country. The
