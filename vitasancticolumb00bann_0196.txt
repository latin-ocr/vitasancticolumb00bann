Ireland, and died in 598, See note Γ, p. 39, su-
pra. There is a good deal of uncertainty as
to the year of his accession, but if the date of
the convention of Druimceatt given in the An-
nals of Ulster be correct, he was sovereign
before 575.

’ἲ Aidanifilii Gubhr‹1ni.—He succeeded to the
lordship of the Scotch Dalriasla in 574, and pos-
sessed sufficient power and address not only to
secure the independence of his race, but to lay
the foundation of that supremacy which it at'-
terwards acquired in Scotland. The account
of his inauguration hy St. Columba7 and the so-
lemn charge he received not to molest the sub-
jects of the lrisb King, are given in iii. 5, infra.
Immediately on his elevation he seems to have
aspired to the forming an independent king-
dom, and to have renounced all subjection to
the Irish monarch 3 nay, as some assert, he went
so far as to claimjurisdiction over the parent,
Dalriada. The Irish monarch, on the other
hand, laid claim to the tributes and service of
the Scotch Dalriada as a colony which was
bound to the mother country. To make an
amicable adjustment of these differences was a
principal object for which the convention of
Druimceatt was held, and 575, the year aster
Aidan's accession, was that in which it took
place. The matter in controversy and the
awai-d are stated in the presaces tothe Ambra,
as follows :—“ The Dal Riada were those about
whom there was a contentiori between the men
of Alba and the men of Erin; because they
were both of the race of Cairbre Righfada, that
is, of the men os Munster. For, upon the occa-
sion nf a great famine which came upon Mun-
ster, the descendants of Cairbre Righfada left
it, and one party of them went to Alba, and the

other party staid in Erin, from whom are the
Dalriada at this day. They took root aster-
wards in those territories, till the time os
Aedhan mac Gahhraim King of Alba, and of
Aedh mac Ainmire, Kingrof Erin. And a con-
test arose between those two kings about them.
And that was one ofthe three causes for which
Columcillo came to Erin, to make peace be-
tween the men os Erin and of Alba, namely,
about Dal Riada. XVhen he came to the meet-
ing, Colman son os Comgellan [whom St. Co-
lumba. when departing from lreland sor Hy,
had met as aboy near Celemnae, and who sub-
sequently died in 625—Ti9l1.]accompanied him,
and Columkille was requested to givejudgmeut
between the men of Erin and Alba. It is not 1
that shall give it, said he, but yonder youth,
pointing to Colman mae Comgellain. Colman
then gave judgment3 and the decision that he
gave was: Their expeditioris and hostings to be
with the men of Erin always, for hostings al-
ways belong to the parent stock. Their tri-
butes, and gains, and shipping¹ to be with the
men of Alba. And when one of the men of
Erin or Alba should come from the east, the
Dal Riada to entertain them, whether few or
many: and the Dal Riada to convey them on,
if they require it.'' (Leabhar na hUidhre, fol. 8 ;
H. 2, 16, Trin. Coll. Dubl. ; Highland Soc. MS.
fol. ¹3 α b.) To the same purport also O'Don-
nell, iii. 10 (Tr. Th. p. 432 b); Keating, Hist.
(Reg. Aedh). The result was, as O'Flaherty
succinetly states: ¹¹ In quo conventu Aidanus
immunitatem a pendendo Hiberniae regibus tri-
buto, adeoque liberi, absolutique principatus
eminentiam adeptus est.” (Ogyg, p. 475.) Ac-
