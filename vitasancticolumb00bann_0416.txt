With respect to the notation of Tighernach⁵ at this year, it must be confessed that
it contradicts the enti-y. For it 15 K. 1111., that 15, that the first of J anuary er on
Wedncsday, which makes E the Dominical letter, and thus refers the occurrenccs under
‘that signatum to 598, two years later than is deducible from the enti-ies. We might
suppose ,1111. by a very common mistake put for .uu., which would mend the matter
a little, and thc antecedent signamres might be treated in the same manner; but then
the .11. which would become .u. would have .1111. as its antecedent, Whereas a ,1. is
found in situ. The Annals of Ulstcr record the occurrence thus, Quies Colm'm cille v.
Id. Jun. mmo etatis sue lxxvi. But their signature is vii„ which gives B as the Sunday-
letter, and indicates 59 5, the very year in their margin, for where they say 594, they
meant 595. Now it is cvident that their record of the event has been advisedly
framed; and, therefore, it is hard to conceive 011 what principle they could refer the
event to so carly a year. In it, Easter fell on the 3rd of April, and Whitsunday on
tho zznd of May, and the 9th of June was Thursday.

Th(-v choice, then, lies between 596 and 597. Το the former Colganu and Dr.
O'Conorv incline3 to the latter tho graver judgments of Ussherw, O’Flahertyg and
Laniganr: but ‘the question would not have arisen if Tighornach had not mentioned
Pentecost ; and it has been shown that, even on his high authority, the introduct-ion of
this element into the calculation 15 irreconcilable with the explicit statements of
both himself and Adamnan. ’

Tuus it appears that during a century, at least, after the death of St. Columba, hi,-
1·‹=mains were permitted to lie undisturbed in the earth. Ven. Bedc extends the period

ἢ Tiqlzernaclz.—1t has been very much the habit
to extol this chronicler as a most accurate chronolo-
gist, but itis tn be remembered that the years printed
in the marg-in by O'Conor are O'Couor's οιυπ, not
T ighemach's. He generally adjusts theru by adding
one to the years set down for the parallel enti-ies in
the Annals of Ulster. This is very often done in op-
positioni to the author‘s own notation. In the whole
range of Irish literary desiderata no work 15 more
iniperassvely demanded than a faithful exhibitiou of
Tighernach's text. In 0‘Conor, it is so corrupt, 5ο
interpolatedv 5ο blundered, that it is extremely un-

5118 to trust the text, while it is certain mischies to
follow the translation.

all through these Annals till 1015, when they right
themselves.
