111οΡ of Ulster. Father Mac Cana, in the early part of the seventeenth century, thus
described it: “ Inter Commor [eumber] et aestuarium Loeh-Laodh [see p. 214, supra]
quod Kamok-fergusium et Belfastium oppida alluit, est eeclesia D. Columbae saera,
quam egregiis agris ae multis privilegiis auxit Niallus O'Niellus [cire. 1512] Tren-
Congalh'ae [Dalaradjae] Princeps.‘’—Ulster J ourn. of Arehaeol. vol. ii. p. 56. The pai-ish

26. TEBnoN-llhet‘mx.——Formerly Ceopmonn omrmmg, and known in the thir—
teenth and following centuries as Temnon-conyn, or Termon-eomzy. It may deiive its
name from Cuinme, sister of St. Columbaw. About half a mile from the old ehureh is
a nearly disused burying-ground, called Rellig-na-man[12este5 no rubeum] or “the
Women's eem(›tery‚'’ and the local tradition is, that St. Columkffl directed a woman
of bad character to be buried at a spot where the sound of a bell, rung 111 front of the
funeral, would eease to be heard at his ehurell3 and that he left an injunction that the
oemetery should never be entered by a liw'ng woman or a (lead man. Dovout women
in old times used to request burial here, under the idea that none interred here would
be damned; but this impression has nearly disappeasedi Outside the old parish
cemetery of Termon there are two others, called Relz'q-na-pm'sde, ‘ Children’s cemetery‚’
and Rele'q-na1fi2·-qz‹22ta, ‘ Gemetery of ‘the slain.' Colgan’s version of O'Donnell incor—
rectly calls the church Tearmmm C'etmm'm'elff. The parish derives its present nam(-
srom the family of Mae Guirk, who were formerly herenaehs, under the Pn‘mate, of
the ecclesiastieal lands in the parish. See Reeves’ Colton, p. 3. It is situate 111 the
barony of Omssgh East, county of Tyrone, and diocese of Armagh.
