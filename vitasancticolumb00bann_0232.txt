small square slah having a Greek cross in-
cised. Attached to this space, on the north,
are the remains os some conventual buildings.
North os them, at a little distance, is the ora-
ton-y, a small roofless building, formed of slates
without mortar, having the door in the west,
and a small, doubly—splayed window in the east.
Α little north-east of this is a very curious
building, with rounded σοι-11615, and one en-
trance in the middle of the north side, without
any traces of windows. Fui-ther off from the
oratory, on higher ground to the east, is a
small building, divided into two compartment5‚
the southern one of which is nearly semicircu-
lar, having a platform of masonry, in the centre
of which is a circular funnel, giving one the idea
ofa kiln. On the sace of the slope south of the
cemetery is a little carn, like a rude altar, and,
beside it, a small square slah with a cross in-
cised. The writer visited the island on the
zznd of July, 1852, in company with his friends,
Cosmo Innes and william F. Skene, the former
of whom has since most truly stated concerning
these remains, “ The crowd of low buildings
has all the appearance of a monastic establish-
ment; and, if it was so, these are perhaps the
oldest vestiges of the sort now standing in
Scotland'’ (Orig. Paroch. ii. pt. 1, p. 277); of

on Loch Columkille in Skye. Mr. Muir of
Leith adds: ‘¹ Eilean Naomh has the enviable
reputation of being closely connected by com-
mon tradition with St Columba, who is said to
have often visited and resided on the island
while prosecuting his missionary labours.'’--

Eilean Naomh, both in the case of this island.
and of that on the north-west of Islay, is evi-
dently a seeondary name. Query, is this Hinha ?

of the following chapter, which come here in
the natural order under the head of virtutum
miracula, are transferred in the manuscripts of
the shorter recension to the Third Book (cap.5),
although that book purports to treat de An-

gives the marginal gloss Hyberniales (Florileg.
