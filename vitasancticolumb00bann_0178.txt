to have received its name from Bregha son *os
Breogan, a Milesian chief. (Keating, Hist. i.

comprised five triocha-chede, or cantreds, in the
east portion of ancient Meath. In aster times
the name was applied to the extensive tract-of
country reaching from Dublin northwards to
near Dundalk, and north-westwards to the
Fews Mountaius. It is still preserved iu the
territory, in the 'form Slieve Breyh, which be-
longs to a hill on the north-east of the count y
of Meath. (Ord. Surv. s. 13.)
