the Southern ny Neill, and his descendants
were represented in after ages by the O'Me-

the civil history of the country as the one in

which was interred in St. Macnissi's chnrch of
Counor, the oldest and most important founda-

manner of Diarmait's death in the ancient Irish
memoir already cited (MS. Trin. Coll. Dub.

Owing to some extraordinary influence the mo-
