His name is not found in the Annals of Uister, but it is entered in the Four Masters, at 797,

He was sui-named Dalea Daithe, ‘ Alumnus Daign'ss and was appointed successor to Cellach

importance, and Hy had declined, the chief of the order began to assume an official rather than a
local title, and to be styled Coarb os Columcz'lle. The year of this Diarmait's death is not re-
corded, nor does his name appear in the Calendar. During his presidency, probably while he

occasion Blaithmac, who seems to have been superior of the monastery, was put to death. Wala-
