IN Praef. z, St. Columba is styled “ monasteriorum pater et fundator‚’' in reference to
the numerous 01111101105 which were founded, either by his disciples, or by himself
directly. Again, in 11. 46 (p. 184), mention is made of 1115 “ monasteria intra utrorum-
que populorum [se. Pictorum et Seotomm Britanniae] terminos fundataff’ In the old
Irish Life the number of his churches is stated as very great, Cp! ce‘o Do 1101101111)
oen 1000110111, ‘ three hundred he marked out, without defeet ;’ an amount which,
even after the most liberal allowances for poetry, round numbers, and pancgyric, will
leave a very considerable residuum.

The following 15 a catalogue of In'sh churehQS, either which were. founded by 111111,
or in which his memory was specially venerated3 but it by no means pretends to be a
complete enumeration :—

1. Dnnnow.—Am·ioutly 1201* 5110110110. It 15 called in Adanman by its In'sh
name Daz'r-maff, but more frequently by a Latin equivalent, Roboretz· Campus, Roboris
Campus, Roboreus Campus& For the history of its foundation, see p. 23, supra. It
was among the earliest and most important, but not the most enduring, of St. Columba’s
foundations in Ireland. The old Irish Life ealls it pecLep, ι11111)ος 011111011,’ and men-
tions the name of Colman Mor, the second son of King Diarmait, in connexion with it.
A seulptured 01055, called St. Columltz'lle's Crass, stands in 1110 churchyard; and near it
is St. Cohemlcille's lVellb. The most interesting relique of the abbey 15 1110 beautiful
Evangeliarium, known as the Book of Duri-ow, a manuscript appmnching, if not reach-
ing, to the Columbian age, and now preserved in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin.
See note M, infra. An ancient Irish poem remains‘, professing 10 have been composed
by St. Columba on the occasion of his dcpasture from Dearmagh for the last time.
