Cainle unappropriated. Mons Cainle certainly
would not suit the plain of Bregia. or the vici-
nity of Trevet. lt was more probably in Scot-
Iand. In this view the word vicinus in next
chapter will have reference to the Saint's pre-
vious place of sojourn, and not to the relation
of the monastery and region, for Trevet was
in Bregia.

ὓ IlIemorata regiona—Probably, not the reyio
Cainle of last chapter, but the Campus Breq of
chap. 38. It is worthy of observation that the
shorter recension of Adamnan's text, repre-
sented by Canisius and Messingham, contains
the present chapter, but omits all that have in-
tervened between chap. 33 and it. Therefore
we must in that text look to chap. 33. or one
immediately preceding, for the correlative to
the present words: but the island of Skye is
the subject of chap. 33, and Hy of the preced-
ing ones. It follows, then, that as the foremen-
tioned region is in this chapter identified with
that in which Trevet is situate, neither Skye
nor Hy can be the place referred to; and that
there must be a chasm in the shorter text3 in
other words, that the shorter is an abbrevia-
tion of Adamnau's original, and not, as Dr. La-
nigan would have it, that the present text is
interpolated. (Eccl.Hist. ii. pp. 109, 246.)

bMonasteriolam—Praef. 2, ii. 7. This diminu-
tive is also found in Bede, where he describes
Dicul the Scot as ‘¹ habens monasteriolum per-
modicum inloco qui vocatur Bosanhamm, silvis
et mari circumdatum, et in eo fratres quinque

the case of Trevet. See next note.

⁶ Trivia—Cimon: in Tighernach and Ann.
Ult. ς sometimes with the epithet mon Α great.’
In the Four Masters the form Cpepou: is occa-
sionally found, which is agreeable to the etymon
cpi pom ‘three sods' given in some ancient au—
thorities cited by O’Donovan (Four Mast. 734),
and Petrie (Round Towers, pp. 97, 99). St.
Lonan, who is commemorated at Nov. 1, was
probably the founder: Ionem o Cnepmz ι
Πώῃθδωϊ) οὗ boum, ‘ Lonan of Trefoit in
Bregia, on the Boyne.‘-—Cal. Dungall. lt is
styled monasteriolum in the text, and appears
to have been, though an ancient, for some time
an inconsiderable, establishment, as neither the
name nor date ofits founder occurs in the Annals,
and the first time it is noticed is 739. However
it subsequently rose to importanoe. and was ad-
ministered by episcopal abbots in 769, 898, and
¹004- From the supposed similarity of the
name to Tredagh. the English form ofDrogh-
eda, O'Conor and others have been led to
identify it with that town; but erroneously,
for its true representative in modern topogra-
phy is Trevet, a parish in the barony of Skreen,
and county of Meath, a little south-east of the
conspicuous church of Skreen. (Ord. Surv.
s. 38.) This church of Skreen was formerly
called Scrin Caluina—cille, and is mentioned by
