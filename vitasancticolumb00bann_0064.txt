ξ 1. sssemoz'r qf St. Adamnan.

DAMNAN², which is said to be a diminutive of Adamb, is a name of unusual

form, and of rare occurrence in Ixish reeords.

The Annals and Calendars prc-

sent but three or four instaneest of it, to which the venerable father of English history
adds another& and then, taking the one best known at home, so treats of it as to make

it πολλῶν ἀντάξιος ἄλλων,

The individual whose celebrity was thus guarantced² was

born in Ircland‘, in or about the year 6243, and though there is no express record of

⁸ Adamnan.-—Adamnan's Life is given in the
Acta Sanctorum at Sept. 23 (tom, vi. pp. 642<649)‚
from the pen of Constantinus Suysfflenus, but it
contains no new matter. The Irish Life, which is
preserved in one of the O'Clery MSS. at Brussels,
furnished the legends on St. Adamuan which ap-
pear in the Breviary of Aberdeen. It is a sort of
historical discourse on Job xxxviii. 3, intended for
the saint's festival; but it is a misci-able production,
full of absurdities and anachronisms. Anything in
it worthy of notice will be found in this memoir.

ι’ Three ursour inmanem—The Calenum-s have
none except our author. The Annals have, besides,
St. Adamnan, bishop aud abbot of Rath-maighe-
aenaigh (An. Ut. 7303 Four Mast. 725); and
Adomnan mac Aiddailedh (An. Ult. 835). Ussher
mentions S. Adompnanns as the successor of St.
Ciarau in Inis-Aingin, now Hare Island, in Lough-
Ree in the Sbannon (Wks. vi. p. 525), and O'Couor
borrows from him (Rerum Hib. SS. vol. ii. p. 138,
n. 42); but Ussher seems ιο have read the name
incorrectly, for in the Life of St. Ciaran, whence he

derived his information‚ the same individua] is called
“Quidam vir de Momonia sc. de gente Corcobais-
cind, nomine Donnanus.''—cap. 28 (Cod. Marsh.
fol. 147 aa). Marian Gorman settles the question:
Dounon paeone: 0 hup Gmssin pop Loeh nib,
‘ Donnan, priest, of luis-Aingin on Loch Ribh'
(Cal. Jan. 7). The Adamnanus of Inchkethe
whom F ordun makes a contemporary of S. Serva-
nus (i. 6), is, by a violent anachronism, intended
for our Adamnan ; but Abp. L‘ssher was too desir-
ous to sweu the history of North Britain, when on
such authority he represented Odomnanus ns an
abbot anterior to St. Columba, and fixed his date at
the year 488(1nd. Chiron.)
