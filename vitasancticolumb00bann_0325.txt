sis, at Brussels, commences thus: *⁵ Sanctus
Kannechus de genere Corcotolano ab aquilo-
nali parte hujus insulae ortus fuit. Cui pater
erat poeta venerabilis, et nomen ipsi dicebatur
Laitech Lecerd, mater vero ejus erat de Nepoti-
bus Mac-Guais [i. e. Ui-mic-Uais]‚ et nomen ejus
vocabatur Meld'’ (p. 1, ed. Marq. Ormonde).
The Life in the Cod. Marsh. at Dublin, begins
in this manner: “Cainnichus sanctus abbas,
de genere Connach-duinne-gemyn [i. e. Cian-
achta of Dungivcn} quae est aquilonalis pars
Hiberniae iusulae, ortus.'' (fol. 124.) His pedi-
gree is prefixed to his Life in the Cod. Marsh.,
and is contained also, but with considerable
variations, in the Book of Lecan, and Mac Fir-
his’s Genealogical MS. (p. 730.) All, however,
agree in representing him as son of Lughteach,
son of Lughaidh, son ofDalann. To these may
be added the pedigree of St. Gronau, or Mochua,
of Balla, who was grandson os Nathi, 8003111-
nech's brother (Colg. Act. SS. p. 791 a).

to distinguish 11, from Cinam pepm mohin,
now Clonfertmulloe. He was of the race of
Ciar, son of Fergus, son of Ros. son of Rudh-
raighe, whose descendants, the (Ῑίιινναὶμὴε,
gave name to several districts in 1re1and, the
principal of which was that now known as the
county of Kerry (Ogyg. p. 276). The surname
mac uo GLcci‚filius nepotis Altae, by which he
is designated both in the text and other native
records (Tighernach, 559; Chron. Scot. 554;
Vit. Trip. S. Patr. ii. 47, Tr. Th. p. 158 a), was
derived from his great-grandfather Alta, whose
son Olchu was father of Finnlogh, the father of
St. Brendan. His pedigree is preserved in the
Book of Lecan, and four versions ofit in the Ge-

neal. MS. of Mac Firbis (p. 729). 1t is also pre-
fixed to his Life in the Cod. Marsh. fol. 56 ba.
The copies ofhis Legend which are preserved at
home and on the Continent are numerous. Ju-
binal enumeratos eleven MSS. ofit, varying in
age from the twelfth to the fourteenth century.
which are preserved in the Bibliotheque Royale
at Paris; besides one at the Arsennl, one at.
Strasbourg, and one at St. Gall (Profaee, pp.
iv, v.) Another is preserved in the Imperial
Library of Vienna, and four more in the Bur-
gundian Library at Brussels (num. 1 160, 2329.
4190, 4672). There is an imperfect copy in
the MS. E. 3, 11, Trin. Coll. Duhl.; and ano-
ther in the Brit. museum (Cotton, Vesp. A. xix.),
which is printed most incorrectly in Rees‚ Lives
ofthe Cambr.-Brit. SS. (pp. 251-254) Colgan,
at Mar. 22, has recorded the Eqressiosamiliae
S. Brendanz: in which he has given three long
extracts from several MSS. of the legend.
(Act. SS. pp. 721-725.) The Life in the Cod.
Mai-sb. commences thus: ‘¹ Natus est beatissi-
mus Brendanus abbas in zepharia [western]
Mumunensi plaga, in regione quae dieitur
Kyarraghi: quae gens est circa oras Littoris
Ly, contra solis occasum. Cujus pater Find-
luagh nomine erat fidelis.'’ (fol. 56 b α.) The
legend in Jubinal opens in a different form:
¹* Sanctus Breudanus, filius Finlocha. nepotis
Alfi, de genere Eogeni e Stagnile [Sti-aguile—
Rees,· Stanguilem—MS. Vindobon] regione
Mimensinm ortus fuit.” (p. 1.) Now the Kyat-
rayhi of Cod. Marsh. is the modern Kerry, and
Linus Ly is Tragh-li, commonly called Tralee‚
the county town. And this name 'frag-li, with
the prefix S. which Irish names beginning with
Tfrequently assume ffleeves, Eccl. Ant. p. 32),
has been corrupted into the forms Stagnile and
Straguile in foreign copies. He founded 01011»
