³ Staynum Cei—hoen Ce in Moy-Lurg‚ com-
monly oalled Louylz Key. The name is of fre-
quent occurrence in the Annals and other Irish
authorities. Lough Key is situate north-east
of the town of Boyle, in the northern part ofthe

naoia sitiss'etcoe-O'Donii. 101. (Tr. Th.405 h.)
See ii. 19, infra.

b Bos dicitur.—At ii. ‘¹9³ it is called by the
Irish equivalent Bo. The river, which gives
its name to the town and barony of Boyle. is
always written in Irish bustl, and latinized
Buellz'a. A monastery, anciently called Ath-
da-laarq, from aford on the river, became affi-
liated to Mellifont in 1161, end was subse-
quently known by the name of Πῖωηητθῃ nu
burne, ‘ Monastery os the Boyle.' See O’Do—
novam on Four Mast. 1174 The river runs
out of Lough Key and enters the Shannon a
little north-west of Kilmore, auciently called
Cili-mon-Dichncnb, the Cella Maqna Deathrib

of the lake and river here, and at ii. 19.

p. ¹49 ὁ, n. 15·) They were a very influentia!
class at all timeS, and from their numbers
when superadded to the olergy, a very oppres-

arose the legend of their Corn runca, ‘Pot of
covetousness‚' which was the depositor-y oftheir
gainS. They are said to have been in danger,
on three occasions, of expulsion from the king—
dom, :md each time to have found in a king
of Ulster a successful advocate of their cause.
It is stated that one of the objects sought by
King Aedh «in holding the convention ofDru‘un-
ceatt was to procui-e from the chiefs of Ireland
a formal sentence of banislnnent against the
body, vbut that St. Columba appeared as their
apologist, and procured a compi-omisa of their
suppression in a limitation ot'their number and
