(Martem, Antiq. Eccl. Rit. i. 3, 8, tom. i. p.
120.) The Irish Church seems to have coin-
cided with the Spanish in its estimate os epis-
copal dignity, and the present narrative comes
with greater weight. being written by one who
not only was a pricst himself, but was officially
disqualified for the higher orden and concern-
ing one who created tbe precedent by his own
subordinate condition.

f Frange panem—W} gathcr from these me-
moirs that the practice of the Irish Church in
the celebration of the Lord’s Suppen at this
period. varied in regard to its ministration;
that sometimes the attendant priests selected
one of their number, either as eminent for piety
(as in i. 40), or for station (as in iii. 17), or be-
cause a visiter, as in the present instance.
Sometimes two, or probably more, acted as
concelebrants, “simul verbis et manu confici-
entes.'' in which case they were wont “simul
dominicum panem frangere:H this as performed
conjointly was, if we may so say, ‘¹ presbyterali
ritu.'' But when a bishop was present, there
being none of equal rank at hand, he “solus
panem fregit,'' and thus the celebration was

expression ‘⁸ audiens presbyterum saera eucha-
ristiae mysteria conficientem,’' from which we
may infer that the consecration was held to be
effected by the sentence os consecration; and
hence it might be supposed that.the invitation
“panem srangere” had reference to the distri-
bution of the bread to the communicants, and
not to the act of consecration. See Mol-inus,
Sacr. Ordinat. Exere. viii.; Valesius's note on
Euagrius's Eccl. Hist. i. 13·

ἕ Veneraeio.-1t appears from a comparis-on
ofcap. 36‚supra, and ii. 1, with the present chap-
ter, that under the Columbian discipline the
several orders of bishop, priest, and deacon,
were duly recognised, and that the conferring
of Holy Orders was considered the peculiar
function of the first. The present narrative
contains not only a plain acknowledgment of
the distinctness of bishop and priest‚ but also
the founder's express declaration ofthe superior
privilege, rank, and honour, of the bishop. In-
stead of the episcopal office being ignored, or
its proper sunction being usui-ped by presbyter-S
in Hy, “a greater respect,¹' as Innes truly re—
marks, “ was in some manner paid to bishops
in that monastery, and a greater distinction
made betivixt them and priests in the celebra-
tion of the sacred mysteries‚ than in other
