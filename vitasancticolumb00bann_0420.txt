of the enshrining may be afforded. After 878 we hear no more of this shrine till 1 127,
when we find the Danes of Dublin carrying it off, and restoring it, possibly stripped of
its gold and silver, at the end of a month. Tighernach, at 976, records the plunder-
ing of Scrin Colu'uneille, but this violence appears to hare been offered to the church of
Columba's shrine, namely, Skreen in Meatffl, where the precious rcliquary may have
been doposited. In 1152, the rmonna or reliques of St. Columba were employed in
conjunction with the great reliquary of Armagh, the Bachzssl J esu, in the solemnization
of a compact; but the reference in that case seems to be to the Sopcelu moricum, 01·
‘ St. Martin’s Gospel‚’ which will be noticed further on as being the great heir-loom of
thc monastery of Derry.

Meanwhile, a fresh competitor for the honour of possessing St. Columba's remains
arose in Pictland, for according to the Pictish Chronicle, Kenneth Mac Alpin, ‘⁴ septimo
anno regni reliquias S. Columbae transportavit ad ecelesiam quam construxit'''. To
which an English record adds : Donne peste& Columcylle on cape, scope pe
if genemnob Duncachan. neah {Sape ea pe i s genemnob tau, ‘ 8000015001οω-
cylle requiescit 111 loco dicto Duncahan juxta fiuvium Tau’u. Hence Pinkerton draws
the conclusion: ‘⁸ It 15 evident that Dzmcahan is mealdan, or Dunkeld, upon the river
Tay; so that the Irish vainly contend that 1115 bones were carried to heland, though,
perhaps, his crosier, or somc other relies, may have been conveycd thithcr'’v. Father
Iuncs declares z “ It is the constant tradition and belief of the inhabitants of Ycohn-
kill and of the neighbourhood atthis day, that St. Columba’s body lies still in this
island, being hidden by picus people, at the time of the new Reformation, in 501110 50-
cure and private place in or about the church, as it used frequently to be in former
ages during the ravages of the infidel Danes; and not only the inhabitants of Ycolni-

the Scots look upon the pretended translation of S. Columba's body to Ireland as fabu-
lousffiv. But this 15 declamation: for in the next page the writer adduces evidence
