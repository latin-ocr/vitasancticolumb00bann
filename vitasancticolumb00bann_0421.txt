for a translation to Dunkcld. The rational statement is this z—The qrave of St. Co-
lumba is in Hy, where his remains were suffered to he till a century had passed.
Meanwhile his dust had minglcd with the earth, and dust with (lust continues there to
this day: but where that grave is. there is no satisfactory evidence to sh0w; and tra-
dition, which claims for the island the ,eustody of the body, fails, as might be expected,
to point out the spot where it lies¹. It was the custom in the eighth century, particularly
in the In‘sh Church, to disinter and enshrine the tangible remains of the founders of
religious houses. There are explicit reeords of the very years when such processes
took place& and that St. Columba's remains were dealt with in like manner, is a priori
to be expected, and in fact proved. The shrine in which these bones were deposited
subsequently became the title-deod of the Columbian community, and was from time
to time taken over to Ireland as the warrant for levying religious contn'hutions‘. But
it soon became exposed to fresh danger z for the costliness of the shrine, which vene-
ration for the fonnder's memory had suggested, excited the eupidity of the roving
Northmen; and Ireland became the permanent asylum of these reliqueS, until it in
turn suffered from the sanie scourge, and even its midland remoteness proved no secu-
rity against the restless Danes. It is possible that, during these constant removals of
the shn‘ne, portions of the reliques may have been taken out, and under the compul-
sion of power, or the inducements of pan-onage, have been shared with other ehurehes ;
thus probably Kenneth Mac Alpin came by his share ; and thus, too, the Irish Sereem

He also refers to some verses which were apl->ended
by the scribe to Cod. B., but which are not now to
be found in that MS.

¹ It lim—Martia says: “ Near to the West
end of the Church in a little Cell lies columbus his
Tomb, but without Inscription 3 this gave me oeca-
sion to cite the Distich, asserting that Columbus
was buried in Ireland,· at which the Natives of
Icma seem’d very much displeas'd, and affirm'd that
the Jrish who said so were impudent Liars3 that
columbus was once buried in this Phace, and that
none ever came from Ireland to carry away his
Oorps, which, had they attempted, would have
prov'd equally vain and presumptuous.”--Western
Islands, p. 258. The place Mai-tin refers to is the
cavity near Martin‘s Cross, opposite the west door
of the cathedral. But this ground does not appear
to have been a cemetery, or, at all events, not to have
been an original one. St. Columba's grave should
be sought for in the Reilig Odhrain.
