were os the same line. They were hereuachs of Ballymagrorty, in the parishes of Drumhome
and Templemore (284, 285), and their name still exists in the neighbourhood in the form
M‘Gronfiy. They were also keepers of the Cathach of Columcille (320). The present indi—
vidual was abbot of Kells when the case of the Cathach was made, and his name appears in the
inscription upon it, in the form Domnallmuzc Robnrtaiq (319). Mention is also made of him iu
the chartei-s of Kells (320). Maelmaire Ua Robhartaigh was 011111 un ΟιΓιῃσ ΟθηαηηΓα,

presidency of Domhnall, Cormac Mac Rechtogaiu was vice-herenach of Kells (ib. p. 130).
In 1 190, a member of the family was prior of Durrow.

² Albanaclt.—That is, Albanicus. The name
Dubhthach is pronouuced Dffl, but in Scotland it
is Gallieised into the form Dutliace. The Scotch
(3310111101- has a saint of that name, Bishop and Con-
fessor, at March 8, whose date is placed by Camera-
rius (not the Brev. of Aberdeen, at ¹249· as Keith
asserts, Bps. p. 186) at 12 53, and whose translation
took place, according to the same writer, 011 1110
19111 of June (De Seotor. Fortitud. pp. 1 12, 113,
159). This saint, who is styled Bishop ⁰f Ross by
Seotch writers, was patron of Tain in Rosshire,
which from him is locaily called Syire Duicli (Orig.
Paroch. ii. p. 416). His name is also connected
with Dor-noch, the episcopal seat of Caithness (ib.

p. 597 ; Brev. Aberd. Propr. SS. Pt. Hyem. fol.
66 α α). Some ofhis relies were preserved at Aber-
deen (Regist. Episc. Aberdon. vol. ii. pp. 160, 167).
The date assigned to St. Duthac, like that of many
os the Scotch saints, seems too conjecturat, and al-
most irreconcileable with the circumstance of his
carly life related in the Breviary of Aberdeen: ‘⁴ Di-
vina instinctus gracia navigio ad hyberniam trans-
fretavit. In quo utriusque veteris et novi testamenti
precepta et leges accuratissime didicit¹¹ (Brev. Aberd.
ut supr. fol. 6 5 ba). This would harmonize with
Ireland's history in the 1 ith century, and even until
1 169 (vide infra), but is hardly consistent with the
state of the country, circ. 1220.

b Ua Maeldoraidh.—His name, which is unintel-
ligible in O'Conor's text of the Annals of Ulster, is
very plain iu 1110 Dublin MS„ moe mo (Ibbom,
‘son oi* the 11111101.Ἴ The Four Masters, to avoid a
supposed ecclesiastical libel (though surely they
could hardly expect to cancel all the Mac nAbs, Mac-
ati-Aspice, Mac-an-tayyarts‚ Mae Phersons, and
Mac V icars, of society), have omitted his· name.
There cau be little doubt that this individual was
sou of Giollacrist Ua Maeldoraidh of No. xn. supra.
