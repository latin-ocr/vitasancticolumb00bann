Adamnan's mention of it is only casual, and as
an introduction to the main event of the chap-
ter, the angelic manifestation. Had there been
no vision to relate, no fact would have been re-
corded; and thus we have a painful instance
of the secondary importance attached by the
biographer to historical narrative. A word
t'rorn him would have freed the inquiry of its
difficulty, but to relate an ecclesiastical occur-
rence for its own sake was foreign to the scope
of his work. O'Donnell, in his endeavour to
reduce the irregular anecdotes of Adamnan
into chronological order, places this occurrence
immediately aster the departure of St. Columba
from the monastery of Clonard. and styles him
‘¹ probus adolescens.”—i. 42 (Tr. Th. p. 395 b).
The present chapter, however, seems to imply
his having now attained to manhood. The
anonymous Life of St. Columba⁷ most probably
compiletl by Stephen White, of which Abp.
Ussher published an extract that had been
communicated to him by that learned Irish-
man, represents St. Columba's conduct in
bringing about the battle of Cul Drcimhne as
the offence which the synod was assembled to
condemn: ⁸⁴ In illo vero tempore, quo haec
fiebant, seniores Hiberniae miserunt per nun-
cios fideles epistolam ad S. Gildam de genere
Saxonum [recte Britonum], ut charitatem mu-
tuam nutrirent. Cumque literas per ordinem
legeret, et epistolam a Columba scriptam in
manibus teneret, statim illam osculatus est,
dicens: Homo qui scripsit hanc, Spiritu sancto
plenus est: et ait unus de nunciis: Ut dixisti
ita θεὶς sed tamen a synodo Hiberniae repre-
henditur. eo quod cognatos suos in periculo
mortis constitutos belligerare jusserit.''—Brit.

Eccl. Ant. (Wks. vi. p. 468.) Ussher accord—
ingly places this synod immediately after the
battle of Cul Dreimhne‚ in the year 561. (lb.
Ind. Chronol.) Whom Colgan follows (Tr. Th.
p. 450 α, n.43). Messingham, in a marginal
note on the present chapter, suggests, ¹⁴ Ob ce-
lebrationem Paschatis'' (Florileg. p. 171 a);
but this is a misconcepti0n‚ because, as Dr.
Lauigan observes, “there was no dispute in
Ireland about the time of celebrating that fes-
tival until after his death.” (Eccl. Hist. ii. p.
150, n. 138.) O'Donnell, to save his patron's
reputation, thus distorts the present narrative:
‘⁸ Improborum quorundam hominum invidiam
provocavit, odia conscivit: qui invidi virtutis
ejus falsum, nescio quod, crimen affingunt, affic-
tumque divulgant. Inde secutum, ut loci An-
tistes insontem excommunicatione impeteret.
Fulminata excommunicatio eum Columbae in-
notuit, ad Episcopum coacto tum Clero co-
mitia celebrantem, convolavit, non magis sure
insamiae, quam multorum scandalo occursurus.
Capitularem locum intranti S. Brendanus Birra
qui tum forte Congregationi inerat, comiter
assurgit,'' δια-ἰ. 42 (Tr. Th. p. 395 b). The
question is discussed by Dr. O'Donovan. with
his usual ability, in his note on the year 555
of the Four Masters (vol. i. p. ¹93)·

¹³ Bremlenus.—This Brendan, son of Neman.
founder of Birr, is to be distinguished from
Brendan, son of Finnlogh, the founder of Clon-
fert. They were contemporary, and intimate
friends of St. Columba. For an account of St.
Brendan of Birr, see cap. 1 1, infra.

'² Birra-Now Birr, commonly called, from
the Earl of Rosse's family name, Parsonstown.
See note on the name, cap. 1 ι, infra.
