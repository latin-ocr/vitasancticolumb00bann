founded by St. Columba, but acknowledging St. Adamnan, or Eunan, as its patron, a
preference probably 1111511ιὲ- out of his maternal connexion with the original occupants
of the district. Concerning Adamnan's early history not one particle of information
remains, nor even a legend⁹‚ save the following aneodote in the life of Finnachta the
Festive, a chief of the Southern Hy Neill, 111111 subsequently monareh of Ireland:
“ Not long after this, Finnachta came, with a numerous cavalcade, to the house of his
sister, whitlier 110 was invited to be her guest. As they were riding along the way,
they 11101 Adamnan, then a sehoolboy, who was travelling upon the same road, with a
jar of milk upon his back. And as he fled from the way, before thexcavalcade, he
knoekesl his foot against a stone, and stumbled, 111111 the jar fell from his back and was
broken. Upon which Finnachta said, Thou shalt receive protection‚ O student, from
me, and he prayetl him not to be sorrowful. Then said Adamnan, O good man, I
have causo for grief, forthere are three goodly students in one house, and three more
of us are attendants upon them. And how we act is this: one attendant from among
us goes out 111 tum to collect sustenance for the other five ; 111111 it was my turn ‘to-day,
but what I had gathered for them has been spilled upon the ground; 111111, what grieves
mc 111010, the horrowed jur is broken, and I have not where-with to pay for it.” Such
is the story, which probably was the ercation of a later age, to introduce a historica]
10011131, 1110 intimacy of Adamnan with Finnachta, and his subsequent interserence
with him. It transposts St. Adaman, in his youth, from Donegal to Mcath; but this
is 110 violence, for St. Columba, before him, studied at Clonard‘ in Meath, and read
with Gemman in a plain of Leinster⁵5 nor was it inconsistent with the severity of mor
11115110 discipline, even in one nobly born, to derive his sustenance from eleemosynam·
But the lesson in the 1310111115ν of Aberdeen forgets all 1110111101)- when it
places Adamnan’s novitiate under St. Columbae, and assigns to the latter the jus patro-
