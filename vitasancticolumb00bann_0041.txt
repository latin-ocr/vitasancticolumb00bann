Pregfaee. xxi

αφιομεν τοις αφιλη ταις ημων. καιμ η εις ενεγκης ημας εις πιρασμων. αλλα pu σαι
ημ ας awo του πονερου. The capricious subdivision of the words is striking1y
exemplified in old Irish writing‚ otherwise one could suppose that when
Greek writing had lately emerged from the continuity of uncial style, the
scribe, copying from such a text, might have been occasionally embarrassed
by the want ofseveralty 111 the words of his exemplar. The Lord's Prayer in
the Codex Sangallensis is 111 a smaller form than this, but it bears a wonderful
‘affinity to it in the shape of the letter3 and even in orthography, for, though
not so reekless‚ it has ελθατω, αφιομεν, and η δυναμεις. The aceompanying
facsimile (Plate ΙΙΙ.) shows some curious particulare in the form of the letters.
The B is in a transition state between Greek and Irish3 the Δ, as 15 more fully
shown in the colophon of the second book, is on its way to an In‘sh Ὁ ; 111 like
manner the A is passing to the λ, and evidences a disposition to omit the light
stroke 011 the left, and leave it an Irish L. The M is written in two ways, the
latter of which, like two C's dos ιι α’σε, with a vinculum, appears in the Book
of Armagh0, as is shown in ‘the annexed facsimile of the colophon to the Gos-
pel of St. Matthewv. Matthaei, not aware of
