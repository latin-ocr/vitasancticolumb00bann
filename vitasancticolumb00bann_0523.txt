whom the island of Rona, situate 50 miles N. of the Butt of Lem’e derives its name.
Port Ronain also, the principal landing-place in Hy, is named after him.

5. csill-Chaz'nnioh, or Ohurch of Cainnech, a small ehapel which stood close to the
site of the present Parish Church. The foundations were removed some years ago, and
a few tombstones are all that remain to mark the cemetery. The patron saint was
Cahmeeh, the intimate friend of Columba (27, 121, zzo), from whom also the neigh-
bouring island of Inch Kenzie‚ formerly a dependent of Hy, derives its name.

6. Caz'beal Mm're, or Mary's Chapel, situate ⁴a short distance to the south-east of
the cathedral. It is in ruins, the gables having fallen, but it seems to have been os
about the same size as St. Oran's chapel. The interior was used for burial in Pen-
nant's time (iii. p. z 54), and several tombstones have been found in it, but without any
inscription.

7. Nameless Chapel, measuring 33 feet by 16, situate near the Chapter House of
the Cathedral on the north-cast, and marked E in Graham's Ground Plan of the Abbey
(Iona, Plate 32).

8. Gleann-an-Teampull, ‘Glen of the Chureh,' the name of a remarkable valley
commencing 111 the middle of the island, at the back of Cnocmor, with a level floor,
and walled in on either side with a well-defined range of hill, inolining towards the
south-west, and opening out on the northern part of the Machar. The namo has long
been asubject of local speeulation as to its origin; but possibly the occurrence recorded
in the Irish Annals, at 120 3, may both account for the name and, with it, for the total
absence of au ecclesiastical remains in the place. “ A monastery was erected by Cel-
lach, without any legal right, and in despite of the family of Hy, in the middle os Cro-
Hy, and did much damage to the town. The elergy of the north of Ire-land passed over
into Hy, and, in accordance with the law of the Chureh‚ they pulled down the aforesaid
monaster-ff (412).

1. Reiliq Odlzrain, that is, Sepulchretum Orani, the ancient burial-place of the
monastery. The name is still in common use, but it is very ancient, as it occurs 111
the gloss on the Feilire of AEngus the Cuidee (204‘). St. Odhran's name was given to
it, probably as he was the first interred therein. His relationship 10 St. Columba is
shown in the Table of Abbots (342). Fordun‚ in one of the anaehronisms so frequent
