There remains another notice of this monastic habit, in an extravagant tale, called
“The Sea-wanderings of Snedgus and Mae Rigail, two of Columeille‘s priests‘'²':

it on the altar of Columeille. And that is
the Cuilesaz'dh of Columcille at this day.
And it is at Kells that it is.

In the foregoing extracts the word is variously written culebot'), ουιιεὺού, cul-

writing in the Book of Ballymotoc, we find the word cuilubet) in conjunction with the
names Colum cuth and Ceolloo. Cormac's Glossary, cited by O‘Reiuy, explains
culpam quasi cml, pulc or puooc, ‘ a defence from eold.’ Stin there is good reason
for supposiug that, as eoooll is the Irish form os cuculla, so culebut') is of colobium,

p. 205, supra, has the following passage:

with the church of Armagh was the CLOC ln
Croesum, ‘Bell of the bequest,' so called because
it was believed to have been bequeathed by St. Pa-
