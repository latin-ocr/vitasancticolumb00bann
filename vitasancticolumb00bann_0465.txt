calami (143), or pens: the cornicula atramenti (54), or ink-horns¹. The books¹¹²‚ at least
those which were intended for earriage, were suspended in pelliceis sace-ulis

(ι 1 5, 116) from the walls¹² (1 17 n.) Among these were the sacra volumina Arnum-mm.
(22 3, 230) of utraque ccmow, or Old and N ew Testaments, possibly in the

form of a bibliothecav or Bihle ς eeclesiastical (3 52) writings3 and profane authors (3 ς 3).

k styles.-From qraplzium, which is of Greek
origin, comes the Irish 5pfflb (205 n.) The Life
of Cainnech represents that saint sayiug to Baithene,
“ porta illi tecum in signum ‚qraffizcm hoe quod iu
aere ex pallio ejus cadens reliquit, quum ille et ego
et Comgailus cito perreximus ad Eugenium episco-
pum Ardsrathae nos vocantem in auxilium eirca
animam Aidui monachi suff—cap. 25 (p. 15, ed.
Ormonde). The very same anecdote is told in the
Life of St. Rnadhan, with this exception that the
style is called puyfflaris, and St. Ruadhan described
as the keeper of it (Act. Sanctor. April. tom. ii.
p. 386 a; Colg., Tr. Th. p. 461 b). These styles
seemed to answer a double purpose.

¹ Ink-horns.—The ink then in use was carbona-
ceouS, not mineral. The writing in the Book of Ar-
magh‚ after 1050 years, is as black as if executed
but yesterday.

π· Books. - At Armagh there was a ceoeh
rcneupcnu, domus scripturarum, in 10203 and
an officer called teubon commodo, custos libro-
rum, in 1136 ς but these are the only references in
our Annals to the existence os a monastic libi-ary.
As to Boece's story concerning the chest osmann-
scripts which King Fergus recovered from the spoils
of Rome, it would be sufficient to say that it is fully
as unreal, and not half so rational, as any of AEsop's
compositions, were it not that there are some, whose
studies lying in another direction, may nothe awai-e
that the alleged donatiou is supposed to have been
made 100 years before the Scotic dynasty was
founded in Scotlaud, 150 years before Columcille
set his font in Hy, and by a king who never ex-
isted! Pope Pius 11. may have intended to v:isit

Hy. and might reasonably expect to find the oldest
books in the oldest monastery in the kingdom, espe-
cially had he known, as we do⁷ that to an Irish
monastery on the Continent the literar-y world is
indebted for the preservation of some classica] re-
mains; but itis much to be seared that the result of
the joumey would have been similar to that ofMol-
denhauer's visit to Alcala, and that AEueas Sylvius
would have had paiuful evidence that Dauish bon-
fires were as bad as Spanish rockets. See Ussher,
Brit. Ec. Ant. c. 15 (Wks. vol. vi. pp. 125, 241).
Bede's account of Acca's libi-ary is a reliable story
(H. E. v. 21).

⁴ When then Longarad died, it is told by the learned
that all the book-wallets of lrelaud seli down on
that night. Or else it was the wallets in which
were the books of every science, in the apartment
where Columcille was, that then sell.' Gloss of the
Feilire, cit. Dr. Todd (Obits of Chr. Ch. Introd.
p. lxxi.) The legend opens by saying that Lon-
garad hid his books from Columcille. Probably this
saint, like St. Finnian, did not wish to have his
books copied
