fortress of Dun-da-bheann was on the north·
western edge of the true Ultonian territory,
while Dun-Ceithern was within the debateable
ground which now constitutes the north os the
county of Londonderry. Cethern was of the
stock of 1r, from which the Irish Picts are said
to have derived their origin (Ogyg. p. 190;
Reeves' Ec. Ant. p. 336); but the possession
passed from his family to the sons of Niall, and
remained so until the battle of Ocha, when it
was temporarily restored to the Dalaradians
or Piets. (See note ς, p. 32, supra.) It was
recovered by the Hy Neill after the battle of
Moin-doire-lothair in 563 (ibim), and thence-
forward was a scene of contention between the
rival taces. In 572, the joint sovereigns of
Ireland, who were of the race of Eoghan, were
slain by Cronan, king of Cianachta, the terri-
tory on the border of which Dun Ceithern was
situate (note ἃ, p. 40, snpra) ; and the battle re-
ferred to in the text arose out of the slaughter
of Suibhne Meann, who was also a sovereign
os the race os Eoghan, by Congal Claen, king
of Uladh, himself a Dalaradian or Pict, who is
supposed to have undet-taken the deed upon the
condition of receiving from Domhnall, the suc-
cessor to the throne, a restoration of the terri-
tory which had been seized by the Cinel Eoghain.

this very fortress was the scene of a conflict,

we again find the lords of the Dalaraidhe and
Cianachta ranged against the chief of the house
of Eoghan. This is the last mention of the for-

ceased to be occupied. In later times even the
name passed out of memory, and O'Donnell,
writing of this interview, vaguely says: ¹* Quo-

—i. 95. (Tr. Th. p. 404 b.) Colgan‚ who was
born in the neighbouring barony of luis-huwen,
does not seem to have been acquainted with the
situation of the place, and, sailing him, it has
been reserved for the great restorer of Irish
topography to identisy the place and its long
lost name. VVriting, Aug. 18, 1834, Dr. O’Do-
novan‚ then employed on the Ordnance Sur—
vey, emphatically observes : ‘¹1 have travelled
through Dunboe, but found no Irish people. 1
visited the Giant's Sconce, and viewed it with
religious contemplation. Ι am perfectly satis·-
fied that it is the Munilia Cethirui ofAdamnam
and the Dun Ceithirn of Tighernach and other
annalists. I have consulted several of the old-
est inhabitants around it. but none could tell
me any legend connected with it. They only
heard that it was called Luuyern in Irish, which
is also the name by which the townland is known
to tax-gatherers.” (Londonderry Lenem, Ord.
Surv. p. 60.) The hill commonly called the
Sconce is the most conspicuous one in the
neighbourhood of Coleraine, situate about four
miles west of that town, in the parish ofDunboe⁷
on the old Newtown rond. It is 797 feet above
the level of the sea, and the top, which is a ta-
ble measuring 160 by 94 feet, exhibits the re-
mains of an ancient fortress. On the west and
south, opposite Bratwell [btmrtebe. Tigh.
