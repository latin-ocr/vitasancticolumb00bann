small village of Salen are the mins of a cell which belonged to the monastery ot' Iona.

23. ORANsAr.—Sepa1·ated from Colonsay at flood-tide only. Here tradition places
the first landing of St. Colmnba 011 his leaving Ireland. It is the vulgar opinion that
the two names denote respective-ly Oran's and Colum's isloi. But this is incorreet:
Colonsay is called Coloso by Adamnank, and there are four islmids of the name in Ar-
gyleshire; while there is an Oronsay off North Uist, and another ofl‘ South Uist, none of
which possess any traces of early eeclesiastical distinction. Fordun notiees the present
island as “ Hornesny ubi est monasterium nigrorum canonicorum, quod fundavit Sanc-
tus Columba”¹. Martin says: “ It is adorn'd with a Chureh, Chappel, and Montist1*y;
they were Built by the famous St. Culzwebus·5 to whom the Chureh is dedicate-(rw.
There may have been an earlier chureh on the island, but the ruins to which Martin
alludes are the remains of a priory which was founded by a Lord of the Isim, and
affiliated to Holyrood. After the dissolution of religious honses, the priory of Oramsny
was annexed to the bishoprio of the 1slcs; hence we find Andrew Knox, bishop ot*
Raphoe, in 1630, who still held the Isles with his Irish preferment, as prior of Oran-
say, granting to Colin Gampbell, rector of Craigness, the isles of Elaehniue ancl Kil-
brandan, with the parsonago and viearage teinds of the same, both which appertssinvd
to the prior-y. In 1635 this grant was confirmed by his successor in the bishoprie ot*
the Islosn. There is a hill in Colonsay called Carn cul-ri-Ert'nffi ¹ Carn of-tho-back-to-
Ire-land ;' and in the north of the island a small ehapel called Tempnll-22a-qlm'ne, where
St. Colmnba is said to have embarked for Hy. The writer in the N ew Stat. Aeeount
suggests, with some. reason, that “ previously to the occupation of the western Islands
