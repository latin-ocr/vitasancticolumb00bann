¹¹ Ailbine.-This is now corrupted to Delum,
hut has no connexion with the true Delvin.
which is Oeolbno, a territorial name. The
Delvin river rises in the county of Meath, and,
flowing through a rocky valley called the Gl‹·n
of Roches, paeses under Knocknagin Bridge,
and falls into the sea at Gormanstown‚ a little
north of Balbriggau. It is an inconsiderable
stream, and is only remarkable on account of
its old asmeiations, and as being the boundary
between the counties of Dublin (ord. Surv. s. 1)
and Meath (ib. s. 28). The present allusion to
it and Dublin is a very curious topographical
notice, for it proves that the territory of Fin-
gall was defined at that early date by the same
limits as iu modern times. The name Ajlbene
occurs only once in the Four Masters. but in
that instance in exactly the same relation that
it does here. A. D. 1052, Cneoch Lo moe

From Muirexlhach son of c‹›nnac.'

This occurs at the close of a poem of twenty-
four stanzas, on the origin of Inblzcr Ailbiue.
Its legend is thus told in the prose recital:
‘⁴ Inbher Ailbine, whence it was named. That
is not difficult. Ruadh mac Righduinu, son of
the king of Fir-Muiridm collected a crew of
four canoes to cross the sea in order to visit
his foster-brother the son of the king of Loch-
lann, When they reached the middle of the sea,
they failed to move in any direction. but stood
as if held by au anchor. Ruadh then went out
over the ship to ascertaiu the cause of the de-
tention, ancl went under the tide, and saw nine
women the sairest ofthe race, holding, three to
each canoe. They took Ruadh with them, and
he lay nine nights with them in their land; and
one of them became pregnant by him. And he
promised to visit them ou his return, is he could.
Ruadh then went to the house of his foster—
brother. and remained with him seven years,
