’ἓ Ad januam slantes—It appears from the
present passage, and those referred to 'm the
preceding note, that St. Columba, when sitting
in his cell, was attended by one or two os the
community, who either stood without, in rea-
diness to receive his orders, οι- were engaged
with him in his studies within.

lar circumstances in cap. 22, insta. Luqbeus

s Maynae domus-Probably the majoris domus
fabrica, which was erected in Durrow while
Laisre, son ofFeradhach, presided there (i. 29,
p. 58, supra). In the titulus of the present
chapter it is called monasterium rotundum.
Concerning the author's meaning, Dr. Petrie
fairly argues that it was ‘⁴ Not, certainly, that
the monastery itself had a rotund roos, because
we know that the monasteries of those days
were a collection of small and detached cells,
each devoted to a single monk ; and certainly
not that the church had one, as it appears from
the notice in the text of the chapter that the

culmen was that of the mayna domus; and be-
sides, from the quadrangular forms of all the
Irish churches of this period, they could not
have admitted ofa dome roof. But more than
all= supposing it were srom the roof of the
church that the monk was falling, or from any
other building, such as we know to have existed
in connexion with the monasteries of this period,
thc Tower excepted, where would have been the
danger, to escape which, the miraculous inter-
position of an angel would have become neces-
sary? Surely not to prevent him from a fall of
twelve fect οι· so, which is the usual height of
the side walls of the abbey-churches of this pe-
riod; nor from the roofs of either the abbot's
house or monks' cells, which, though usually
round, were seldom, if ever. ofa greater height
than twelve seet, aud from which, having rarely
upright walls, there could have been no serious
danger in falling. In short the miracle, to be
a miracle at all, requires the supposition that
the round roof on which the brother was at
work must have been that of a buildiug os
great altitude, and from which a fall would be
necessarily productive of certain death‚——such
a building, in fact, as a Round Tower, which
was the only one of the kind the Irish had,
either in those days, or for many ages aster-
wards.'' (Round Towers, Ρ. 383.) The pre-
sent chapter of Adamnan supplies a most
valuable link in the history of the Round
Towers; it points to their primary use as mo-
nastic abodes, known by the name Monasterium
Rotundum, and regarded as belonging to a class
os building called moytia or major domus, as
