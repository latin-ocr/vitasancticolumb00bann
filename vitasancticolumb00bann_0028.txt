peculial· heavy hand which is found in the oldest Irish manuscripts, not indeed
as round as that of the Books of Kells or Durrow, but >possessing many fea-
tures in common, and claiining priority to the Book of Armagh, the date of
which is fixed to the year 807. 2. The Greek character which appears in the
text, as shown in the following faesimile os the colophon ofthe second book—

ψικιτκιι) εκμαωὸυοιιδερμ

and more at length in the Lord’s Prayer, which is written on the last page of
the manuscript, in semi-uncins, without accents or breathings. 3. The parch—
ment, which is made of young goat-skin‚ and evidenees by its colour and con-
dition extreme age. 4. The remarkable colophon of the scribe, which, taken
in connexion with other evidence, is of the greatest weight. It isin rubrio on
page 136 α, and records the name Dorbbeneus (242), one of extreme rarityr, in
Irish records, and ofwhich the present w'riter knows no examples but the two
which are mentioned in the Annals, in connexion with Hy. One of these is the
entry at A. D. 724, which reeords the death ofFaelcu‚ son ofDorb'ene(38 1, 382),
and the other that which records the death of Dorbene‚ who was elected to the
chair of St. Columba at Hy in A.D. 713, and died the same year (381). The
former Dorbene was probably a layman, and anterior to Adamnan3 the latter
was probably only half a generation junior to Adamnan, whom he survived
but nine years. To ascribe the manuscript to this individual is to claim a very
early date for it, and it may be objected that it was written by another person
of this name, 01· copied by a later hand from the autograph of this Derbene.
The former exception is not probable‚ the name being almost unique, and
found so pointedly connected with the Columbina society3 the latter is less
probable, as the colophon in Irish manuscripts is always peculiar to the actual
scribe, and likely to be omitted in transcription, as is the case of the later ma-
nuscripts of the same recension preserved in the Bn'tish Museum. ς. The
judgnients of those who have examined it. Colgan, on White’s repert, saysu3
‘⁶ Exemplar illud Codicis Augiensis tam vetustum et tanta fide et integritate
exaratum est? ut nisi Codex ipse esset in Germania repertus, non aliud vide-
retur ab eo, quod S. Dorbeneus Abbas Hiensis, S. Adamnani discipulus, ipso
Adamnano adhue vivente, vel paulo post ejus mortem, sua manu scripsit.'’
