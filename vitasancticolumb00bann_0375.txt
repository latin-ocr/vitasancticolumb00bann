COUNTRY.

Cormae, offspring of Liathzm, of aspect brightss,
The champion of heaven and of emh,
Came out of his southern, wat-m country,
Upon a xisit, upon a pilgrimago.

From tho south, from tho broad rapid Lui‘‚
To Cormac's cross at Caindruim.

At Cormae's cross at the church,
Thon rang the soft toned bell
Here at Catamael'ss city.

And to meet him came together
Our dex-out, stedfust congregation.

Thou art weleomo here, thy face is pleasant.
Ο Cormae, since thou art devout:
Thy coming· hjther with speed
Was a long time since foretold.

Abide here, for thou art a perfect divine,
Ο Comae, of character unbroken,
That thou mayest be the proper guardian,
That shall be in my (levout city.
