Roman Easter, may have attended synods of
the Irish clergy: indeed it is scarcely to be
conceived that he could otherwise have effected
such a change as Bede describes (Η. Ε. v. 15).
But the reference in the text must be to an
earlier period of his life. The Life of St. Gerald
states that Adamnan spent the last seven years
of his life in the presidency of the Saxon abbey
ofMayo (Colg. Act. SS. p. 602 a). This account
is open to exceptions; for it is a suspicions cir-
cumstance to find Adamnan unable, as Bede
states, to make any impressiou upon the Co—
lumbian communities which were subject to
him, yet cordially received in a monastery of
settlers, who had left their home and travelled
to a strange country, to avoid acquiescence in
that ver)v system which their honoured visitor
was now endeavouring to promulgate. 111 re—
ference to the synod mentioned in the text,
Colgan (who seems to have been beside himself
at the moment) questions whether it was any
other than the Convention of Drumceatt (Tr.
Th. p. 384 b, n. 36); upon which the Bollandist
editor observes: “ Meminisse debebat Synodum
Drumchettensem, nou tempore Adamnani, sed
S. Columbae celebratam.” (Jun. ii. p. 226 b.)
=Plebe yeneris Loerni.—Colgan, despite of
the text, conjectures ιοῑΙιανιια, now Larne, on
the coast of Anu-im (Tr. Th. p. 384 b, 11. 37);
aud, for want of better information. is followed
by the Bollandists (Junii, ii. p. 226 b). Pinker·
ton, who should have known to the contrary,
fixes it “In boreali parte Hiberniae⁷' (p. ¹52)·
O'Flaherty‚ however, puts the matter in its
true light: ‘⁶ Quatuor in hac colonia primariae
Dalriedinorum illis fratribus oriundae sunt fa-
miliae, viz. emet ηδαῦῃωη. Gaurani familia,
emet Loomn, Loarni familia, unde Lorna su-
pradicta regio in Dalrieda videtur denominata,
Cmet nGnfinro,AEueze familia, et emet Coti]-
finili, Comgalli familia.'' (Ogyg.p.470.) This

is borrowed from the Irish tract on the Men os
Alba preserved in the Books of Ballymote and
Mac Firbis. To the Cinel Locum we find the
following references in the Annals of Ulster:
A. C. 677⁷ Inter-fertio Generis Loairnn i Tirinn.
A. C. 718, Bellum maritimum Ardenesbi inter
Dunclzadh mBecc [reqem Cimztire, 720] cum
Genere Gabhrain, et Selbacum cum Genera
Loairn, et versum est super Selbaclzum pridie
Nonas Septembris vel Octz'mbris, die vi. serie in
quo quidam comites corruerunt. A. C. 732, Mu-
redae mac Ainscellach reynum Generis Louirnd
assumit. Selbaeh, tenth in descent from Loarn
Mor, who has been already mentioned as chief
of the Genus Loairn, occupied Dun Ollaiq,
now Dumssy, near Oban (An. Ult. 685, 700,
713, 733), and it became the chief stronghold
of the Cinel-Loairn, as it continued to be of
the district of Lorn, when Mac Dougall was its
lord, and as it still is, of the representative of
that ancient branch of the Mac Donnells. This
race of Loarn was closely allied to the founder
of Hy; St. Columba was grandson οἰ Erca,
daughter ofLoarn Mor; and, of the first twelve
abbots of Hy, nine, including Adamaan, were
descended from her. This connexion naturally
gave the community a great hold upon the re—
gat-d of their nearest neighbours‚ and rendered
Adamnau's short sojourn among them less irk-
some than it would otherwise have been, In
after times, when the race had permanently
established themselves, the word cinei, or
Genus, was dropped, and their seulement
took the name simply of their founder, and
appeared in the form Low, which, from being
a secular name, was borrowed sor ecclesiasti-
cal convenience also3 and hence in the thirteenth
century we read, not only of the sheriffdom, but
os the rural deanry of Lorne (C. Innes, Orig.
vol. ii. pt. i. pp. 91, ¹09). One of the sub-ter-
ritories of Lorn was Kinnelbathyn [emet boe-
