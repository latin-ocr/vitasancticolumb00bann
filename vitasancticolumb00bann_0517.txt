Somerlid, the Requlus de fflrer- Gaedelt, married a daughter of king Olave¹¹‚ the suc-
cessor of Magnus, who brought him four sons, one of whom, Dubhgall, was thrust into
the sovereignty of the Isles in 1154. Consequently, awar ensued, and in 1 1 56 the strife
was terminated by the cession to Semerlid and his 50115 of the southern islesn includ-
ing Hy, a measure which naturally terminated the N orwegian ascendancy, and restored
the supremacy of the Celtic influence around. As a result, the abbaey of Hy was
offered, in 1 164, at the instance of the king, and with the unanimous consent of the
church officials, to Flaherty O’Brolehan, the energetic abbot of Derry, who, 111 addition
to his dignity of Coarb of Columcjlle, had received, in 1 158, the noco important quali-
fication of episcopal orders. Domestic influence prevented the offer from being acccpted;
but the Irish clement, already indicated by the names of the ecclesiastical function-
aries, in 1164, seems to have rapidly increased, and to the period of its development we
may possibly refer the erection of the central portion of the Cathedral. Bishop
O'Brolchain was busily employed, towards the close of the twelfth century, 111 rc-edi—
fying the ecclesiasticcl buildings of Derry; and to a kinsman of his is probably attribut-
able the commencement of the most important structure now existing in Hy. The
unusual record on the capital*v of the tower column, noNAans onnorcnm rncrr noc orvs,
and the coincidence of that record with the obit of Domhozall Ua Brolelzm'n in the Annals
of Ulster at 1203, and of the FourMasters at 1202, the same name inits Irish form, arc
sufficient, if not to satisfy the mind, at least to afford material for reasonable conjec-
ture, as to the builder. 111 1203, MichaeF, bishop of the 15105, died at Fountain
Abbey, and was succeeded, according to the Chroniele of Man, by Nz'elzolas, whom Torfaeus
calls [solus-n observing that, for the forty years preceding, the Haebudae were without
an actual bishop; ‘that is, that the office, as regarded the 15105, was nothing more than
titular. But 40 years, subtractos] from 1203, bring us back precisely to the date at
which Somerlid and the clergy of Hy solicitcd the services of St. Columba's coarb in
