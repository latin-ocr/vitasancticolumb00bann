4 34 Additional Notes. [Q.

the sovercignty was enjoyed for so long a period by the family whose settlements lay
next Ireland, one would naturally conclude that the nucleus of the colony was origi-
nally planted there, and that the accession of territory northwards was the result of
Subsequent increase in population, rather 111311 the original occupat-ion of the chiefs,
whose names the several districts afterwards came to bear. Cantyrer and Knapdale
seem to have been the cradle of the race (377), and though Lorne bears the name of
the first ruler after the emigration, it seems to have received it in after times rather
from his descendants than himself, the Genus Loarm', who extended themselyes in a
northerly direction when the settlements of the mling family became too narrow for
all. The Irish tract says that six sons of Earc removed to Britain: Loarn Mor and
Loarn Beg, Mac Nisi Mor and Mac Nisi Beg, Pergus Mor and Pergus Beg3 adding, in
reference to Aongus, who remained behind, cujus tamen semen in Albania est. Now
these duplicate names are partly a device to multiply the number and make it square
with other statements. Resides, Mac ,Νεὶςί was not peculiar to any one, it was a family
11110 derived, according to the custom of the day, from their mother, whose name was
Nisi, and Fergns Mor is as often called Mac Nisi as he is Mac Eirc. The pedigrees of
the race recognise only five sons whose posterity became known in Britain. namely,
Loam Mor, Aongus Mor, Aongus Beg, Pergus Beg, and Pergus Mor; of these, the first,
fourth, and fifth became the most distinguished, and founded what the Irish tract calls
*⁴ the Three Pozcerfzcls ofDalrz'ada, namely, the Cinel Gabhrain, Cinel Aengusa, and
(711101 Loairn Mor.” Loarn Mor was the founder of the 011101 boumn, 01· Genus
Loerm‘,· Aongus Beg was the founder of the 011101 (ΙΘΠδυΓα, Genus AEnqzwii, who
settled in Islay; and the family of Pergus Mor separated in his two grandsons, Com-
gall and Gabhran, into the two house of CmeL Comgmbb, Genus Comqallz', who gave
name to Cowal, and 011101, Setinum, Genus Gabhramg who retained the original set-
tlement in Cantyre and Knapdale. F ergus Mor was 511000οᾶοᾱ by his son Domhzmgart,
who was married to a daughter of Brian, a descendant of Eochaidh Muighmcadhoin, who
was sovereign of Ireland from 358 to 365. Their 50115 were Comghall and Gabhran,
aheady mentioned. Comghall's son was Conall, the sixth king of British Dalriada, the
conallus rexfilius Comqill of Adamnan (32); and in his reign the monastery of Hy was
founded. Here arises the old question (151), Who granted that island to St. Columba?
Bede says: “ Venit autem Brittaniam Columba, regnante Pictis Bridio filio Meilochon,
rege potentissimo, nono anno regni ejus, gentemque illam verbo et exemplo ad fidem
Christi convertit: unde et praefatam insulam ab ez's in possessionem monasterii faciendi

taniae pertinet, non magno ab ea ficto discreta, sed donatione Pictorum, qui illas Brit-
