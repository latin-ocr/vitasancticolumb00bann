concerning Hy.

The stated Labour was agriculture, in its various branehes, as aratio (106, 175),
‚seminatio (175), messio (72), trituratio (56), portatio (72): there were, moreover, the
dii-ersa monasteri opera (210), 511011 as mulsz'o (125), opus pistorium (209),
fabricatio (58, 106, 217), leyatz'o (43) 011 sca (47, 106, 110, 111), and land Labor.
(43, 60, 163). Besides we may presume that there was the preparing of
sood, and the manufacture of the various articles required forpersonal or domestic use.

The individual wants of the members were the subject of discipline
as well as their conduct, and the three great requirements of the body susum-nm.
quectz'o, Habitus, and Requz'es, were supplied according to conventual
measure, prescribed and practised by the founder, and afterwards established by usage.

The ordinary Refectiou (51) was very simple, consisting of brcad (109, 110) some-
times made of barley (106) ς milk (125, 155, 231); fish (128, 129, 238);
eggs 4 348 n.); and, probably, seal's flesh (78). On Sundays and Festivals Refectia
(211), and on the arrival of guests (51), there was an improvement of (liet,
consolatio cibi (50, 58), refectionis z'ndulqentz'a (51), which consisted in an addition to
the principal 111001, prandioli adjectio (211); 011 which occasions it is probable that
flesh-meat was sen-ed up, as mutton (78), or even beef‘ (143). The number of 1110015

monasteries to delay refection tffl nona, or cvening, except on Sundays and Holydays.
st. Cainnech’s prandium (122) was not taken till post nonam (122); but this may have
been at a special 5005011, such as Lent, or a fast-day. At this chief meal the menia (97,
99), 01· contributions of the faithful (98), were partaken of (121). It is likely, how-
ever, that St. Columba's discipline was 111111101- than that of St. Comgall, and that it
resembled St. Benedict’s, which allowed dinner at twelve, and supper at evening, every
