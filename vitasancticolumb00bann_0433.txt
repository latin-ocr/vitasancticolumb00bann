beinge free, were given to the aimeestors of the said Donogh O'Momeson, whoe in
those daies were servaunts to Collumkills: and in the said parishe are sixe gortes of
glebe, whereof three gortes belonge to the vieear, and thother fower gortes to th(-
keeper of the mz'ssaffllz or ornaments left by Colu1nkill’'‘¹. By this it appears that th(¹
word misach, being interpreted ‘ ornaments‚' was supposed to be the plural of moire,
‘ an ornament,' and not derived, as tho form of the word would indicate, from mir, ¹ a
month.⁷ This interesting reliquary having often changed hands, and having been ear-
ried away to England, finally became the property of the present Earl of Dunraven,
who generously presented it to the College of St. Columba near Dubh'n‘, where it is now
preserved. The following extract from an ancient tale, ealled The Death of Mn'rcertaeh

mae Erca‘, contains the earliest allusion to this reliquary :—

Caimcchg blessed them, and left them
gifts, i. e. to the Clanns Conaill and
Eoghain. That when they should not
be ehiefs, or kings of En‘n, their influenee
should extend over every province around
them ; and that the eoarbship of Aileeh,
and Tam, and Ulster, should be with
them; and that they should not accept
hire from any one, because the sove-
reignty of Erin was their own inherent
light3 and that their hostages should
not be loeked up, and that deeay should
come upon the hostages who should ab-
scond; and that they should have victory
in battle, if fought in a just cause, and
that they should have three standards‚
viz„ the Oatlzaeh, and the Bell ⁰f Patrick,
i. e. the Bell qf {he testament, and Cair—
πειθὼ Masada ‚· and that the virtue of all
these should be 011 any one reliquary of
them in time of battle, as Cairnech be-
queathed them; ut dixit, διο.
