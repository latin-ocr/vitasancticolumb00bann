AEC sunt duodecimb virorum nominac qui cum sancto Columba de Scotia, primo ej us

Coniug, sancti successor Columbae; et Cobthachm frater ejus3 Ernaaffl, saneti amnoulus

ὃ Discipuli ec Comata—This recitai follows close
upon Adamnan's narrative, and forms part of the
text, in Cod. B. Although annexed by a later
hand, it is evidently of great antiquity, and drawn
from authentie sources, probably from reeords pre—
served at Hy, the school whence cod* B. originated.
There is no counterpart to be found among our Irish
manuscripts, but some of the particulars appear in a
tract ascribed to AEngus the Cffldee, who flourished
about a century after Adamnan ; while others can be
verified by independent authorities.

b Duodecim-See iii. 4 (p. 196) snpra.

C Nomina-They appear, with sundry inaccura-
cies, iu Fordun (Scotichr. iii. 26); and still more
disguised iu Hector Boethius. (Scot. Hist. lib. ix.
fol. 166). Dempster perverts almost every name,
and, as Ussher says, solita fretus licentia, makes
every individual an author and a saint (Hist. Eccl.
Scot.) Abp. Ussher, who consuited Cod. 13„ exhibits
the list more faithfulxy (Brit. Ec. Ant. c. 15, Wks.
vi. p. ²37)· Colgan borrows from him, and com-
ments upon the names in detail (Tr. Th. pp. 468 b,
486 b); as also the Ordnance Memoir of Temple-
more (pp. 26, 27). Pinkerton has printed them cor-
rectly (Vit. Antiq. p. 186); from whom they are
transferred, with a few alterations, into the Origines
Paroch. Scotiae (voL ii. pt. 1, p. 285).

*1 De Scotia ad fflttanniam.—Fordm alters the

expression to Sentium αάηαυίῃαιέιᾞηη Boece to
venere cum eo in Albionem‘ But the foi-ni in the
text agrees with Adummim Praef. z (p. 9), i. 7
(p. 31)7 36 (p. 67), ii. 39 (p. 156), iii. 17 (p. 219).

Columba's father. See Genealogical Table oppo-
site p. 342y infra.

in the Calendar, but without any authority (9166).
