[Lis. 111.

qui illius seniores ⁹coetus seorsim ¹⁰ceteris redarguerent ¹¹semotis, dicentes,
¹2Quare coram excommunicato surgere ¹³et eum exosculari l⁴non renueris?
taliter ad eos inquiens, Si vos, ait, videritis ea quae mihi Dominus hac in die
de hoc suo, quem dehonoratis, electo manifestare ¹⁵non ¹⁶dedignatus est, nun-
quam excommunicassetis ¹⁷quem ¹⁸Deus non solum, secundum vestram non
rectam sententiam, nullo excommunicat modo, sed ¹⁹etiam magis ²⁰ac magis
Illi e contra, Quomodo, aiunt, ut dicis, ipsum glorificat Deus,
quen] nos non sine ²²causa excommunicavimus, scire cupimus P Ignicomam
et valde luminosam, ait Brendenus, columna-m vidi eundem quem vos despi-
citis antecedentem Dei hominem. Angelos quoque sanctos per campum ejus
itineris comites. Hunc itaque spernere non audeo quem populorum ducem ad
vitam a Deo praeordinatum video. His ab eo dictis, ²³non tantum, ultra Sanc-
tum excommunicare non ausi, cessarunt, sed etiam valde venerati honorarunt.

·¹ Hi Tema-There being no Latin preposi-
tion in the clause, it is plain that the particle
Izi, which is the Irish for in. must be understood
as supplying its place. Thus in the seque]
to this Life, preserved in the eod. R, we find
‘⁴ qui sepultus est hi Cuiluisci'’ (fol.7o a). In like
manner, in the Latin memoirs in the Book os
Armagh, 1ιὶ ΗαίιΙι-οὴιιηρί, hi Tamnuclz (fol.
11 bb). hi Muiriscc (sb. fol. ¹3 ba), Izi Rath-

name which is written Coiuce in Irish records.
It was a place in Meath, situate between Kells
and Naxum, famous in old times for the great
annual assembly and fair, called nonos> Cenu-
cenn, which was held there about Luyſtrzoe, or
the first of August, of which we find eleven
notices in the Four Masters between the years
539 and 1 168. Taillte was also a seat of roy-
asty, so that the monarch of Ireland was some—
times styled 1³¹3 Cuiucenn, ⁴ King of Taillte'
(Book of Rights, p. 143); and as the ancient

Irish synods generally embraced representa-
tives of the secular as well as ecclesiastical
authorities, and were, for this reason, held in
places of civil note, as Tara, Uisnech, and
Cashel, we can easily perceive the principle
upon which the present synod was held at a
royal station iu Meath, especially if the object
was⁵ as white, Ussher, aud Colgan suppose, to
censure St. Columba in precipitating the battle
of Cul-Dreimhne, Dei-mot Mac Cerbhaill being
monarch of Ireland at the time, and Meath his
hereditary dominion. A remarkable record of
the union of the secular and religious in refer-
ence to this place and saint, occurs in the An.
