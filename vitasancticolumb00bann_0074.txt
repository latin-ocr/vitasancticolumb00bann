11-0land. This, however, is a conclusion drawn t’rom unsound premises, for it supposes,
as some Irish accounts have done, that Adamnan quarrelled with his people; also that
the Irish Columbians yielded, while the Hyensian ones held out. The one supposes
Adamnan to have been expelled from his pastoral charge 3 the other is contradicted by
Bede. The Life itself bears the fullest internal evidence that it was written by a
member of the society, who speaks of nostrum monasterium (pp. 58, 72, 177), living in
the island, nostra insula (12, 178), which was small and remote (241), among other
islands (185), and called Iona insula (176, 181).

Conneeted m‘th the joumey to Ireland in 697, the Annals record a transaction
which thcy despateh with enigmatical brcvity: Dedit leqem innocentium populis. In
which words they allude to a soeial reformation which was brought about by Adam-
nan, and which, having obtained the highest sanc-tion of the pcople, became, as in the
vose of many modern Acts of Parliament, associated with the name of the propounder.
A synod was conrened at Tarm, within an enelosure called the Bam-na-Senadh, or
¹· Ruth of the Synods,’' where the meniory of the chief actor was perpetuated in the
ntimo Pupam Adhamlmaz'n, or “ Pax-ilion of Adamnan‚⁷' which was given to a portion
of the space; also in the Sm‘rllse Adleamlmm'n, or “Adamnan's chair;’⁷ the Dumha
Aclhanzhnaz‘n, or “Adaman‘s mound;’' and the Oros Adhamlznm'n, or “Adainnan’s
πνοῆς-β’ situatcd on the east of the Rathn. This mopooib, or ‘convention-general,’
was held, as the semi-legendary records state, at the instance of Adamnan, for the
purpose of proeiuing a national enactment, exempting women from war and expedi-
tions. Thc legend concerning the intlucncc and circumstances which brought Adam-
nzm to interfere in the matter may be seen at p. 179 of this work. The acts of tho
eonvention were copied by Michael O'Cicry from the Book of Raphoeb‚ aud are pre-
served in one of the Irish manuscripts at Brusselsc. There were present thirty-nine
ecclesiastics, presidi-d over by Flann Febth the Abbot of Armagh, and among them
were Iehtbroehtd, or Eegbert, probably the individua] who brought the Hyensians to
paschal conionnity in 7163 and Murchu Mac U Maoteni²‚ the writer of a portion of

¹ Tarm-The Irish Life of Adamnan places this
convention at the place now known as Bauyshan-
uon: ‘⁴ On another occasion when Adamnan was at
the royal niceting [ῃιῑς-Ὸωῑ] of Conall and Coit-
pre, at Eas Ruaidh, making his Law, the roydamna
of thc son of Ainmire„ i. e., Flannabhra, son oreum-
mascach, came, having with him a female captive
who had killed a woman, to subruit the case to
Adamuan,” ἃς. Colgan conjectured that the conveu-

tion was held at Derry or Raphoe. See p. 178, infra.
The acts of the convention do not state where it
was held, but it might be inferi-ed to have been at
Leitir, near Birt, on the confines of ancient Meath

and Munster.
