¹³ Mocasuilni.—The elan name by which he
was distinguished, Colman elo nme Ui Sextii.
—(Tighernach, 6113 Annal. Ult. 610; Four
Mast. 610.) He was descendet] from Eachach,
son of Muiredhach, whose legendary destruc-
tion by the expansion of the rivel· Bann gave
to that sheet of water the name ot' Loeh neos:-
(τεὴ, now called Locli Neayh. His descendant
in the sixth generation was Clothrach, who had
two sons, each giving name to a sept; namely,
Fedhlim Samae, or Salline, the head of the
Dal Sailne, or Dal Selli,· and Fedhlim Euan¹
the head of the Dal ruffinam-(Mac Firbis,
Geneal. MS. pp. 102, 728 ὂς Irish Nennius,
p. 268; Dinnseanchus in Book of Lecan‚ fol.
252 bb.) Every man iu the elan Dal-Sailne
was a moe Ui Sostne.

is very frequent. Thus Bede's Colmanus (H.
E. iii. 25, 26) is Columbanus in the Annals of
Ulster‚ 667, 675, and Tighernaeh 676. Colman
Mor of Irish history is Columbanus in Adam-
nan (i. 14). So ii. 15, 16, iii. 12. See Usshev,
Brit. Ec. Ant. c. ¹7- (Wks. vi. p 536.) This
Columhanus is the Colman-Eala or Colmanellus
os the Irish calendar, Sept. 2⁶3 and the patron
saint of Kilcolmonell on the east of Knapdale
in Argyle‚ and of Colmonell in Ayrshire. See
the note on the name at ii. 15.

Ε Charybdis Brecamz—See the titulus of ii.
13 ‚where Cod. Β. adds, ‘⁶ in vortice Brecain.“
Called by the Irish Come bneemn, ¹ Brecans
Cauldron.' from the peculiar motion of the
water, and the tradition that Brecan son of
Maine [ob. A.D. 440} son of Niall of the Nina<
Hostages, was engulfed by it. Although the

that in Adamnan’s day this Corry-Brackau
was situate near the lrish coast: its connexion
with the island of Rathlin in the title, and the
expression ‘⁸ transnavigare iucipiens’¹ in the
chapter, are sufficient proofof this. Part of the
