tion or disregard of the episcopal office; for there were at all times bishops connected
with the society, resident at Hy‘ or some dependent chureh, who were subject to the
abbot's jurisdiction‘: that is, who rendered him conventual obedience, agreeably to
their monastic vowg; whose acts were performed on the responsibility of the abbo& or
in the name of the community¹; and who were assigned their stat-lons, or called in to
ordain, very much as the bishops of the Unitas Fratrumk in the present day, being re-
garded as essential to the propagation of the Chmch rather than its maintenance; and
who, therefore, had as little authority in the inter-nal economy of the society, as the

pp. 266, 269). Bishop Cronan, who visited St.
Columba, dissembled his rank (p. 8 5, supra); and in
like manner the famous Fergil, or Virgilius, ‘the
Geometer,' who, from being abbot of Aghabo in Ire-
land, was appointed by Pepim king of the Franks, to
the monastic see of Saltzburg in Bavaria, entered
on the abbatialdutieS, but “dissimulata ordinatione

to the Annals of Ulster, in 788.

Β Hy.—Five bishops of Hy are mentioned in the
Irish Annals at various dates. See Chronicon
Hyense. in note Ο, infra, Ann. 622, 712⁷ 966, 968,
978, 987. Innes conjectures that the subscription
Episcopus Myensis to the acts of the council of
Calcuith in 787 is a mistake for Hyensis.—Civ.
Eccl. Hist. p· 186.

f Jurisdiction.—“ Cujus jur-i et omnis provincia,
et ipsi etiam episcopi, ordine inusitato, debeant esse
subjecti.''—Bede, H. E. iii. 4. As regarded the
Scotic Church, it was not unusual. Notker Balbu-
lus, unacquainted alike with the geography and
history of Ireland, says: “In Scotia insula Hiber-
niae depositio S. Columbae ..... Adeo ut Abbas
monasterii cui novissime praefuit, et ubi requiescit,
contra morem ecclesiasticum, Primas omnium Hi-
bernieusium habeatur episcoporum.”-ll1artyrol.

Η. E. iii. 3. ⁴⁴ Aidan quippe qui primus loci [Lin-
disfam] episcopus fnit monachus erat et monach-
icam cum suis omnibus vitam semper agere solebat.
Unde ab illo omnes loci ipsius antistites usqne hodie

ceterique gradus ecclesiastici, monachicam per om-

Cudberti, cap. 16 (p. 241, ed. Smith).

lumba's displeasure fell, not on the officiating bishop,
but on the presiding abbot. See p. 70, supra.

nantes, ad praedicandum misenmt.‘'-Bede‚ H. E.
iii. 5. “A majoribus meis accepi, qui me hue epis-
copum miserunt.'‘—Ib. iii. 25.

k Unitas Fratrum—‘⁴ Ordination, which among
us is conferi-ed by bishops only, is required by those
who administer the word and sacramento, to give
authority for all church transactions. Our episco-
pacy gives to the individual who holds it no title to
a share in the government of the Brethren's Church,
or of any individual congregation. A bishop has
no diocese committed to his jurisdiction. A bishop,
like every other servant of the Unity, must receive
a special appointment to any office which he holds,
from the Synod, Suc. Ordinations to the different
Church-degrees can be performed only by virtue of
an express commission from the above—mentioned
authorities. The consecration of bishops is gener-
ally arranged by the Synods.''—-Results of the
Synod held at Heu-nhut⁷ 1848, pp, 149, 150 (Lond.
1849), The expression Clzurch-deyrees reminds one
of the Irish ytatius ecclesiastici.
