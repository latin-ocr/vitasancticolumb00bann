writingsu. Adamnan’s two remaining Latin works give proof of his classical attain-
ments, and Gummian's Paschal Epistlev is a remarkable specimen of the eeclesiastical
learning of the day. To the English students who frequented Ireland in the seventh
century, the natives supplied libros ad leyendumW, and Hy was not likely to fan short
in its literary provision. For collective reading, they were probably furnished with
the lives of saints (Adamnan quotes Sulpicius severus? Life of St. Martia (3), and Con-
stantine’s Life of St. Germanus (149)), which were collected in a miletum,- auditis very
likely that for this kind of reading the life of the founder, as written by Adamnan, was
reduced to the form in which it is foruid in the shorter reeension, where tho titles of
the chapters, and most proper names are omitted, as calculated to interrupt or encum-
ber the tenor of the narrative. St. Benedict prescribed the reading, after supper, of
collationes vel vitas Patrum, aut certe aliquid quod oedz'fleet audientes (cap. 42).

VVriting formed a most important part of the monastic occupations; the founder
was much devoted to it (143, 21 ς, 2 3 3), and many of his books were preserved (116,
117, 175). His successor also practised it (53, ²33)- Besides the supply
of service books for the numerous ehurehes that sprung into existence,
and which, probably, were written without embeffishment‚ great labour
was bestowed upon the ornamentation of some manuscrith especially the sacred
writings; and the Books of Kells and Durrow are wonderful monuments of the eon-
ception, the sinn, and the patience of the Columbian scribes in the soventh century.
Giraldus Cambrensis’sr glowing description of the Gospels of Kildare is hardly strong
enough to express the excellencies of thc Book of Reus. Of their ordinary Latin hand
in the eighth century, Cod. A. ol' Adamnan is a fine specimen². This manuscript eon-

Irish words entered in the margin. The other is
