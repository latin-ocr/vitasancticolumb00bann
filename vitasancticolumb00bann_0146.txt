Amo in tempore, curu vir beatus in ⁴ scotia per aliquot demoraretur dies,
ad supradictum Aidum, ad se venientem, sic prophetice locutus ait, Praecavere

commiseris, non toto patris regno, sed ejus aliqua parte in gente tua, brevi

tle of Cooldrevny was fought. The epithet
bnon-bachum which O'Conor interprets baculi
dolorosi, seems to have reference to the ‘pil-
grim's staff! By supplying the word filii be-
fore eommani in the title we have the exact
lineage given by Mac Firbis; while the word
mors in the passage cited from the Annals, as
opposed to occisio or juyulatio, indicates the na-
tural death recorded in the text; and the date
648, reckoning even from the latest period
of our saint's life, allows ample time for the
subject of the prediction to become a senex.
Such harmony in three independent recor-ds is
a remarkable attestation of their accuracy.

² Aidus Slune.—Eldest son of Diarmait Mac
Cerbhaiss, by Mughaina (vit. S. Aidi, Colgan,
Act. SS. p. 4²0 u); and surnamed from the
river Slaine, near which he was born. (Reat-
ing, An. 587.) As heir to the lordship of the
Seuthem Hy NeilL he was a consenting party
to the grant of Ceanannus, or Kells, to St. Co-
lumba. (O'Donnell, i. 64„ Tr. Th. p. 400.) On
his father's death he succeeded to that dignity,
and, about the year 580, at the instance of St.
Columba, possibly on the very occasion men-

the church of Lanu-Elo or Lynally was subse-
quently built. (vit. S. Colmaneli, MS. Ε. 3,
1 1, Trin. Coll. Dubl. fol. 106 a b; Ussher, Wks.
vi. p. 530.) On the death of Aedh son of Ain-
mire, in 598, he, and Colman ffimidh, one of
the Ceuel Eoghain, were elected joint sove-
reigns. His abode was on an island in Loch
Leibhinn, now Lough Lene, near Fore in West-
meath. (vit. S. Feehini, Colgan, Act. SS. pp.
135 b, 141 a; Vit. S. Aidi, ibid. p. 421 a.)
