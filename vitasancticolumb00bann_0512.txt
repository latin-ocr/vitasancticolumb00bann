founded a church seemingly at Lismore, called the benceoc mneilioro, ‘Oratory of Maeliosa,¹
which was burned in 1 1 16. He died on the 16th of January, justly celebrated for his learning
(Colgan‚ Acta SS. p. 108). His son, Αο(111,- succeeded himin the calling of professor, and died in
109 5. Two years afterwards a son of Maelbrigffle, ειη-1111111011 Mac-an-tsaeir, who was bishop

Ua Brolchain, also bishop of Armagh, died, «Jan. 29, 1 ¹39· The latter was probably father of
the coarb Flaithbertaoh, whom the Annals of Ulster, at 1 164, call leffoepcueh mue m
erpuic 11111 bp oleam, ⁴ Flaithbertach, son of the bishop Ua Brolchan,' a lineage by no means
in accordance with the delicacy of the F our Masters, and which, when copying the entry, they
divest of its objectiouable character, in simply calling him Plumbencuch Uo bnolt'mm.
Domhnall Ua Brolchaiu was prior of Deny, aud died Apr. 27, 1202. His name is inscribed on
one of the capitals in the cathedral of Hy, in the form Donaldus Obrolcan (vid. 1202, infra).
Finn Ua Brolchan was steward of O'annell in 1213 ς and Flann Ua Brolchaiu was coarb of
Columcille in 1219. 111 1548 died sir John Obrolchau, rector of Kildalton, inIslay(01-ig.
Paroch. vol. ii. p. 2⁶9). The name was afterwards written O'Brollayhan, and is now cor-
rupted, in Ulster, to Bradley, Through the influeuce of Gilla-mac-Liag or Gelasius, the abbot
of Armaghv who had himself been previously abbot of Dei-ry (an. 1137), Flaithbertach Ua
Brolchaiu was raised to the dignity of bishop in 1 158, as is thus recorded by the Four Musters:
⁴2 A synod of the clergy of lreland was convened at Bri-rnic-Taidhg, in Meath, where there were
present 2 5 bishops, with the Legate of the coarb of Peter, to ord-zia rules and good morals. It
was 011 this occasion that the clergy of Ireland, with the coarb of Patrick, ordered a chair, like
every other bisbep's, for the coarb of Columeflle, Flaithbertach Ua Brolchain, and the arch-
abbacy of the churches of Ireland in general.'' He was a zealous advancer of the welfare of
Derry, aud during his incumbency many important additions were made to its ecclesiastical
buildings3 to procure funds for which, the abbot had, during the years 1150, 1151, 1153,
1161, visited, and obtained contributione from various territories in Ulster and Ossory. After
a long life spent in the euergetic discharge of his duties, he died in 117 5, at which year his
obit is thus recorded by the Four Masters: ¹¹ Flaithbertach Ua. Brolchain‚ coarb of columcille,
a tower of wisdom and hospitality, a man on whom, on account of his gooduess aud wisdom,
the clergy of Ireland had bestowed a bishop's chair, and to whom the abbacy of Hy [00ῆὶοῃ-
bur loe] had been offered (au. 1 164), died in righteousness, after exemplary sickness, in the
Duibhregles of Columcille: and Gilla-mac-Liag Ua Branain was appointed to his place in the
abbacy.’'
