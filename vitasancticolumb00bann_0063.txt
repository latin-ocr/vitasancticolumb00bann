one follower of Thomas Dempster.'' Scottish history now confesses the pro-
prietorship of ancient Ireland in the name Scotia3

‘⁶ Seque novo veterum deceptum errore locoruu1.”

Even were positive evidence wanting, the language of the Highlands‚ called
Ersei, which is only another form of Eryschek‚ or Irish, would indicate the
origin of the people who spoke it, and point to Ireland as the ancient home of
the Scotch. From this mother country issued St. Columba, and almost anthe
early saints of the Scottish calendar. Coming from Ireland‚ yet frequently
revisiting it, they maintained their old relation: so that their memory was
equally cherished in either country, and a common (lay appropriated to the festi-
val of each. One of these Irishmen, in particular, was styled a Fe7·-da-Zeitlze¹‚
or ⁶ Man of two p01·tion5‚’ from his divided service. An humble aspi-
rant to the name, the present editor, as labourer in common for the Archaeo-
logical Society of Ireland and the Bannatyne Club of ScotlamL trusts that he
also, in the region of his inquiry, has, with some success, been a ⁴ man of two
portions:’ he can with confidence asserta that he has made diligence the com·
panion, and truth the guide of his way, whether on the road or in the study;
and that he has so far attained the object of his divided laboure, as personally
to have enjoyed, during tho progress of the work, many seasons of relies from
the sorrows of a troubled mind, and many hours of genuine happiness in social
or epistolary intercourse with deal· and highly·valued friends on either side of
the channel.

In 1661 Mr. Robert Campbell was refused ad-
mittance as minister of Kilarrow in Islay, “for
want of the Yrish tounge'' (Orig. Paroeh. vol.
ii. p, 261). In 1663 the Scotch Parliament, on
the petition of the bishop of the Isles‚ allocated
an annual sum for ministers who ‘¹ had the
Yrish tounge’' (ib. pp. 16 1, 294). One ofthe sta-
tutes of the old Grammar School of Aberdeen
(A. D. 1553) gave the students the option. ‘⁶ Lo-
