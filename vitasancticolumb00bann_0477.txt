d Mannum—The Isle of Man was so called (An.
Ult. 986), but the tract here intended was probably
the debateable ground on the confines of the Scots,
Picts, Brstons, and Saxons, now represented in part
by the parish of Slamannnn (Shno lllunonn,

Β Constantine.-Aband0ning the throne of Coru-
wall, this prince became a monk under St. Mochuda
or Carthach at Rahen in Irelund, whence he passed
over to scotland, and founded the church of Guvan
on the Clyde. His labours were extended to Can-
tyre, where he suffered martyrdom, and where is ει
church, Kikhousland, called after his name. His
festival iu the Calendars both of scotland and Ire-
land is March ιι. See Fordun, Scotichr. iii. 26:

ἕ Lismoer.—This is the Lismore of scotland,
whose founder, Molua (generally called by the Scotch
llloluay)y was, in after times, the patron saint of the
diocese of Argyle. T hc name comes to the Scottish
form thus: Lnylzaidh, contracted Lua, familiarized
Luay, dignified Illolnay. Lismore of Ireland was not
founded till the expulsion ofSt. Mochnda or Carthacn
from Rahen in 636. The Neman, abbot of Lis-
more, who died, according to the Four Mast„ in
610, must have belonged to Scotland.
