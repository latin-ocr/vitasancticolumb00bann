The principle of OBEDIENCE is embodied 111 the precept of Columbanus: “ Ad pri-
mum verbum senioris omnes ad obediendum audientes surgere oportet, quia obedientia
Deo exhibetur, dicente Domino nostro J esu Christo ; Qut· vos audit me aucle't,·”

sonable to suppose that this essential of monastic order was strictly obser-ved

to exposure 111 out—door work, attho local Superior's desire, dun'ng the most inclement
weather (57), or to undertake an office of responsibility, though by a nephcw's order

ther forsook the church of his sojourn, and hastened, at the abbot’s call, to Hy, there
to abide in vera obedientia (60). Obedienee, however, had its limit to things lawful:
