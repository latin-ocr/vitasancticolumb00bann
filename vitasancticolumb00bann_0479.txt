Four Masters (an. 622), and the Calendar of Donegal, is very questionable (224). An excep-
tion to the precedent so recently established in Hy by the founder would hardly have been sanc-
tioned in the case of the fourth abhot, especially as Beda, a century afterwards, emphatically
says, “Habere autem solet ipsa insula rectorem semper abbatem presbyterum'⁷ (H. E. iii. 4).

Son of Fiachna, and nephew of Laisren, the third abbot. He was a zealous advocate of the old
Paschal observance, and was addressed on the subject in 634 by Cummian, in an epistle which

is superscribed “Segieno abbati Columbae sancti et caeterorum sanctorum suceessori” (Ussher,
Syll. xi„ Wks. vol. iv. p. 432); aud by the Clergy of Rome iu 640, whose epistle on the same
controversy was addressed, among other presbyters, to Seyenus (Bede, H. E. ii. 19). Adamnan
calls him Seyinffls (16, 26, 11 1), and refers to him as the informant of Failbeus‚ his own imme-
diate predecessor. Bede mentions him as ⁴* Segeni abbas et presbyter'¹ (H. E. iii. 5).

implies that this Mongan was killed at cluam-Air-
thir by men from those districts. This place has
not been identified hitherto, but there is little doubt
that it was the Cluain of the Airtheara, now Magh—
eracloone, in the county of Monaghau. One of the
parties killed there was Ronan, son of Tuafflal,
lord of the territory. Fiachna Lurgsm, the father
of Mongan, was son of Baedon, king of Uladh
(Reeves, Eccl. Ant. pp. 340, 353). Baedan, who
died in 581, was a powerful prince. An ancient
poem in the Book of Lecan (fol. 139 αα), aud Mae
Firbis's Geneal. MS. (p. 491), represents him as re—
ceiving tributas from Munster, Connaught‚ Skye,
and Manu. One verse says:
