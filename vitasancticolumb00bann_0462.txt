The ordinary Garments were two ε the cuculla (136), of coarse texture', made of
wool, and of the natural colourj of the material; and the tzmz'ca (141), an under-gar-

mentk, which was occasionally white (¹75)-

Instead οἱ the former, when

usamenta. the weather required, was worn a warnier gai-ment called ampla'baluffl (25,

113).

The cuculla, sometimes called casulam and capuan, consisted of the

body and the h00d0, the latter of which was sometimes specially tel-med the casula.
When working or travelling, they wore calcei? (122, 210), which were fleonee (12 3 n.)

¹ Come textura—The Life of St. Cadoc represents
an angel saying to St. David, ⁴* quot cirri sive jube
in tua coccula, quod vulgariter vocatur quoddam
genus indumenti, quo Hibernenses utuntur deforis,
plenum prominentibus jube seu villis in modum

Brit. SS. p. 44).

k Under-yarment.—St. Kiaran's was called pal-

¹Amphilzalns.—See the reference to the Life of
St. Deicola at p. 114. supra. St. Benedict's Rule
says ε “ Mediocribus locis sufficere credimus Mona-
chis, per singulos, Cucullum et Tunicam: Cucullum
111 hyeme villosam, in aestate puram aut vestutam;
et scapulare propter oper-³²⁸ (cap. 55).

ω Casula—The Life of St. Kiaran relates that
one day, meeting a beggar, he gave him his cassula,
and proceeded in his pallium to luis-Cathay, when

St. Senan meeting him said: “Nonne pudor est
quod sacerdos in uno pallio sine cucullo ambulat.''

occurs in cap. 20 (ib.)

¹¹ Capu—St. Comgall's Life relatos that ‘¹ Quo-
dam die cum esset S. Comgallus solus in agro foris
operans, posuit chrismale suum snper vestem suam.
Cum ergo venissent gentiles ad S. Comganum soris
operantem, et chrismale suum super cappam suam
w'dissent, putaverunt chrismale illud deum S. Com-
galli esse.⁷'-—cap. 22 (Flem. Coll. p. 307 b). The
chrismale, it may be observed, was a box for carry-
ing the consecrated bread of the Eucharist, probably
the ineupfflp of the Book of Armagh (sol. 18 α b).
In St. Dega's Life an anecdote is told similar to that
in p. 141, supra, but instead os tunica the garment
is called capa (Act. Sanct. Aug. tom. iii. p. 659 b).

υ Hoozz—St. Kiaran's Life says of his houd,

trick saying, noema aum 16 pil pop corrui

the number of the hairs that are on the casula of
thy cowl, the same number of sinners 1ο go to
heaven, sor the Hymn.’—Leabhar Breac, cited by
Dr. Todd, Book of Hymns (Ir. Arch. Soc.) fasc. i.
p. 33. See note ἰ, supra, for the Welsh version of
the indulgence. The Life of St. Deicola draws a
distinction which seems unique, ⁴⁸ succinctus cuculla
