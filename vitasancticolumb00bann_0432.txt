10. Boon or Keras—This wonderful manuscript was preserved at Kells, in the
county of Meath, at the time that Archbishop Ussher wrote his Antiquities of the Bri-
tish Churches, as appears from his words cited in the preceding article. It had existed
there for many centuries‚ and was traditionally called the Book of Columeille. The
costly shrine with which it was enclosed nearly proved its destruction in the beginning
of the eleventh century, as we learn from the Annals of Uls‘aer, as also the Four Masters
at 1006, where it is related that “the Great Gospel of Columcille was stolen at night
from the western sacristy of the great church of Cenannus. This was the principal
relic of the western world, on account of its remarkable cover. And it was found after
two months and twenty days, its gold having been stolen off, and a sod over it.'’ For-
tunatcly, the manuscript itself sustained little injury (it received more from the plough
of a modern bookbinder), and in the course of the following century its blank pages
were considered a fit depository for copies of certain eharters of the elerenth and
twelfth 0011101105, connected with the endowments of Keflsb. Arehbishop Ussher became
possessed of this manuscript, and after his death it was in great danger of being lost:
but it escaped‚ and on the Restoration it came, with what remaincd of the archbishop's
library, “ ex dono Caroli 11.” into the custody of Trinity college, Dubh‘n, where it re-
mains‚ the admiration and astonishment of every one who examines it.

1 1. ΤΚΒ lamen-A manuscript, but of what, is unknown; for, conversely to the
fate of the Books of Reus and Durrow, the case remains, but its contents are gone.
The custody of this reliquary was hereditary in the family of O‘Morison, who were the
herenachs of Clonmany‚ a parish in Inishowen, and it continued in their possession till
the abolition of old church tenures reduced them to a state of penury, and they were
induced to part with it. The case is of wood, overlaid with wrought silver, and is or-
namented with ecclesiastic-al figures resembling those on the case of the Cathach, as
may be seen in the published dsawingc. An inscription in two lines appears on the
upper side in these words:

‘ Briau, son of Brian O'Muirguissan, covered me, Anno Domini 1 534.’

The keeper of the reliquary in 1609 was Donogh O’Morison, who was a juror at an in-
quisition sped that year at Lifford, where it was found that a quarter named Donally
was “free to Donnogh O'Morreesen, the abbots' corbe and the busshop Derrie’s here-
nagh of those three quarters: that the other three quarters of the said six quarters
church land were given by the O Dogherties and O Donnells to Oouumkffl, as a dediu
