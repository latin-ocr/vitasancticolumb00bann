whose son, DomhnalL king of Ailcluaithe (see
note b, p. 43⁷ supra), died in 694. This battle
was fought in the valley of the Carron in Stir-
lingshire. At 650, is recorded the ‘Death of
Cathasaeh‚ son of Domhnall Breac.' At 673,
is recorded the Juyulacio Domainqairt mic
Domhnaill Bricc reyis Dalriata. In 689, BIors

death of Maelduin, the royalty passed to Fer-
cbar Fada, of the house of Loarn, who was
able to entail the dignity on his descendants.

conjectures that this was the bishop Aidau
who was sent in 635 to convert the Nerthum-
brians, and died in 651. But as it appears

Aidanus was an adult, it is not likely that he
could have undertaken the active duties of a
missionary sixty or seventy years after.
