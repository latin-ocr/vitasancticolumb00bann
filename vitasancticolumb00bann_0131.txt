the period of St. Columba's visit to Clonmac-
nois that columbanus, by his advocacy of the
Irish rule at Luxeu in Burgundy, was beginning
to draw down upon himself the displeasure of
the neighbouring bishop3, in reference to which
he addressed some letters to Popes Gregory Ι.

⁷ and Bonifaee IV. (Fleming, Collectan. pp.
¹10, 113⁷ 157.) The Roman missionaries who
visited Britain in 597 brought the mei-its of the
rival systems under more immediate consider-
ation, and as they were commissioned to ex-
ercise pastoral superintendence over the ¹¹ Scots
who inhabited Ireland,” a remonstrance from
the newly founded See of Canterbury‚ about
605 (Bede’s H. E. ii. 4), seems to have had
weight with a portion of the Irish Church, and
a bishop called 'serenantis was iudueed to adopt,
and become a zealous advocate of, the reformed
rule. (Vit. S. Laurent. ap. Ussher, Wksi iv.
p. 422.) The question soon began to assume
the form osa national controversy; and to give
weight to the Roman side of it, Honorius 1.‚
about 630, sent a letter to Ireland urging upon
the opposite party the consideration of their iso-
lated position. (Bede, H. E. ij. 19.) At the same
time Cummian appeared in a synod which was
held at Campus Lene, or Magh-Lena, near the
modern Tullamore, in theheart of Ireland, where
he pleaded sor uniformity with such effect that
the assembly was on the point of pronouncing
a‘favourable decision, when an individual ofthe
company, whom he styles “ quidam paries deal-

batus‚” stood up and roused the dormant prc-
judices of some present, so as to cause an
adjournment of the proceedings. (Ussh. Syll.
xi.) Shortly aster, another conference was held
at Campus Albus, near Carlow, where the en-
deavours of Laisrean, Abbot of Leighlin, were
overruled by the influenee of Munna (the Fin-
tenus of i. 2 supra). (Vit. S. Munnae, c. 25, Cod.
Marsh, sol. ¹29 α ας Ussh. Wks. iv. p. 342, vi.
p. 505.) By this timc the inhabitants of the
island had separated into two gcographieal
partios, after the old civil division of the coun-
try into the Northern and Southern Halves:
for Bede, in reference to an occurrence of 634.
writes, that while the “septentrionalis Scotto-
rum provincia” still adhered to the old practice.
the “gentes Scottorum, quae in australibus
Hiberniae partibus morabantur. jamjudum, ad
admonitionem apostolicae sedis antistitis, pascha
canonico ritu observare didicerunt.'¹ (H. E.
iii. 3.) This distinction we find practieally re-
cognised in the superscription ofa letter sent
from Rome in 640, which is addressed to eleven
ecclesiastics, who are proved by Irish records
to have belonged to the northern division of the
island. (Bede, H. Ε. ii. 19.) WVhatever effect
this appeal may have had, it is certain that the
Columbian monaster-ies continued steadfast in
their profession, and from time to time gave
evidence of their firmness by the character οἶ
the bishops whom they sent to Lindisfarne:
Aidan in 634; Finan in 652; and Colman in
