editor observes, ‘⁶ vix omnem anachronismi
suspicionem tolles.'’ (Jun. tom. ii. p. 187 b.)
The truth is. there is a serious anachronism in
Cummian, which Adamnan has endeavoured to
correct, subjecting himselfto the difficulty only
of making a man ajuvenis at forty-two.

s Duodecim discipulis.-Their names are pre-
served in the sequel of Cod. B„ and have
been printed at various times with more or
less incorrectness. See Additional Notes.

² Alio tempore.-Tighernach, with whom the
Annals of Ulstcr and Ussher agree. places the
death of Couau, son of Comgall. AEdan's pre-
decessor, at 574. T. 1nnes, whom Chalmers
follows, refers it to 571· But the former is a
much higher authority.

¹⁷ flium-See i. 21 (p. 50), 45 (p. 87), ii. 24
(p. 135), supra; chaps. 17, 18, 23. iufra. The
identification of this island remaius the great
desideratum in Hebridean topography.

¹⁴ Vitreum librum—Called vitreus codex fur-
ther on. T. Innes says of it: “This ceremo-
nial book is called by Adamnan, Liber Vitreus,
because, perhaps, the cover of it was encrusted
with glass or crystal.’¹-Civ. Eccl. Hist. p. 202.
He supposes the contents to have been “the
prayers and ceremonies of the Ordinatiou or
inauguration of kings.’' (lb. p. 200.) From
the context, however, it may be inferred that

Ν quodam D.

(- himba B. F. hymba D. Cum-

the present expression is not intended as a
proper name, but rather as descriptive⁷ and
that the idea conveycd is ‘a book of glaSS‚'
containing heaven’s decrees eoncerning the
succession of earthly monarchs, among whose
names that ofAEdan was expressly entered, as
the individual destined to govern Dalriada,
This was the proeroyntiva monarchioe proedesti-
nata, mentioned in i. 14 (p. 42) supra, and the
Deo auctore ordinatio of i. 1 (p. 16), 36 (p. 68),
supra. This book osglass, ‘⁴ clear as crystal,‘'
was only presented to the saint while in an
extasis mentis, and on ear-h occasion of its pe-
rusal was delivered by the angel. It contained
the fiat ofAEdan's inauguration3 and the saint's
hesitation πᾶς, not an unwillingncss to cmploy
any formulas supposed to have been contained
therein, but a reluctance to receive the object
of heaven's choice instead of his own. See the
story told by Bede of the soldier's vision, iu
which “ candidum codicem protulerunt angeli,
deinde atrum daemones.'' (H. E. v. 13-)

d Ei commendatum-This may either mean
that an injunction to ordain AEdan was spe-
cially addressed to him, or, what is more likely,
that the will of Providence concerning AEdan
being herein communicated to him, it became
his duty to perform it.
