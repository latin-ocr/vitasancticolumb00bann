f &demone—So the name appears in the
MSS„ and so it was in the copy which Ussher
nwd3 hut that which was employed by Colgan
:ind the Bollandists seems to have changed it

503. The following record of the battle is
found in Tighernaeh, immediately after the
mention of St. Columba’s departure to Hy:
A. C. 563: “The battle oi Moin-Daire-Lothaire
against the Cruithne by the Hy-Neill of the
North3 in which seven kings of the Cruithne
were slain, with Aedh Breac. Baedan son of
Conn, with two of the Cmithne, fought against.
the Cruithne; and the Cinel Eoghain, and
[Cinel] Conaill [were those] they fought; con-
ducti mercede [os] the Lee and Ard-Eolairg.”
Some verses of Cennfaeladh upon the battle are
then cited, from which we gather that the cause
..r the battle was an unjust partition, and that
Elne. the territory between the Bann and the
Bush, was, on the occasion, wasted with fire.
The belligerants were the Cruithne or Dalata-
dialis, aud the northern Hy Neill; the latter of
whom engaged in the strise at the instance of
a Cruithnean chief, who seems to have been
wronged by his own people,and who covenanted
10 surrender to his auxiliaries the territory os
Lee and Ard Eolairg. on the west side ol‘the
Banu, which had been ceded to the Cruithne by
thr· Hy Neill, aster the battle of Ocha in 483.

From the mention of Lee and Elne, it is likely
that the scene ot the battle was not far from
the town of Coleraine. See the note on Muni-
et'o Ccthirni, cap. 49 infra.

¹¹ Conallo filio Conzyill.—He succeeded his
uncle Gabhran, in 560, and was followed on the
throne by his first cousin Aidan, The present
passage gives some support to the statement in
Tighernach that the grant of Hy was made by
him rather than the Picts: A. C. 574, bssl‘l·

⁰ Ainmorius filius Setni.—Sedna the father
of Ainmire, and Fedhlim St. Columba's father,
were brothers, being sons of Conall Gulban.
Ainmire. helped to win the battle of Sligo in
543. and was one of Dermot's successful oppo—
nents at Cooldrevny. After the battle men-
tioned in the text, he was reinstated in the
possessions οἷ his father Sedna. (Tighernach,
563.) These included the present barony ot'
Keenaght, in which DruimCeatt was situate,
and explain the cause why that district was
chosen for the convention which was held in
his son's reign. He became sovereign in 568,
and reigned three years. Tir Ainmz'reclz, the
old name of the barony of Boylagh in the county
of Donegah was derived from him. (O’Dono-
vau. Four Mast. 1343.) We have his name in
the form Ainmuirey at 111. 5 infra.
