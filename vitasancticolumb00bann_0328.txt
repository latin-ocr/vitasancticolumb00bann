[11113. 111.

111 quadam exedrae, quae oratorii adhaerebat parieti, devotus orabat. Et post
aliquantum quasi horae intervallum unius, vir venerandus Columba eandem
sacram ingreditur domum, simulque cum eo aurea luX, de summa coeli altitu-
dine descendens, totum illud ecelesiae spatium ⁹replens. Sed 81, illius exedriolae

presideney over Hy, that is, between 679 and

(p. 16), 49 (p. 95), supra, cap. 23, infru. The
titulus being omitted 111 the Bollandists, the
words supra memoratus which refer to it are

0 Exedra.-Further on we meet with the di-
minutive eredrioloe separatum conclave. The
term, which is bort-owed from Cummian. de-
notes a small chamber, or chapel‚ attached to
the side osa church. 11 was probably the name
of au apartment formed 111 the same manner as
Aidan's lodging under the opposta or destina
os his church outside. (Bede. H. E. iii. 17.) The
lrish word 01100111 15 employed in a similar
sense. See Petrie's Round Towem, pp.432-438,
The exedra is called cubiculum lower down.
Adamnan uses 1118 word exedra iu his tract* De
Locis Sanctis also, where speaking ofthe churoh
ou Calvary he says : ¹¹ quaedam inest exedra in
qua est calix Domuum-i. 8 (mabillon, Act. 85-
