buried the Scotch kings down to Malcohn Oeann-more; herc Eegffid, the North-
umbrian king, was buried in 684 (187); hither were removed the remains of king
Godred in 1188 (chron. Mam), and of Haeo Ospae in 1228 (ia). Of these kings
no monuments remain, and the chief part of the interesting tombstones that are found
there belong to the. Clanns Finnguine, Gilla—Eoin, and Guairc, since known as the

This is called a burial-place : it must have been in very early times cotemporary with
other cairus, perhaps in the days of Druidzfsm. For Bishop Pocock mentions that he
has scen two stones, 7 feet high, with a third laid across on their tops, an exident
