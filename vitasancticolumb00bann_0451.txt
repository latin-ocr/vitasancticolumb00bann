injunction was “ Omnibus venientibus sive discedentibus hospitibus, inclinato capite
vel prostrato omni corpore in terra, Christus in eis adoretur qui et suscipitur’ffl. To
the same principle may be attributed the custom which was common to St. Benediet
and St. Comgall, and which probably extended to St. Columba, as a received observancc
of the time: “ Si quis frater pro quavis minima causa, ab abbate vel a quoeunque priore
suo corripiatur, sine mora tandiu prostratus in terra ante pedes ejus jaceat satisfaciens
usque dum benedictione sanetur ina commotio''⁸. St. Oomgall’s Life says: ‘⁵ Mos crat
in monasterio saneti patris Comgalli, ut si quis alium increparet, quamm‘s ille esset
culpabilis aut ineuipabHiS‚ statim qui increpabatur genua humiliter fiecteret‘'‘. The
strict observanee of this regulation is exemplified by legends showing the extraordinary
lcngths to which eomplianee with the letter of the precept was carried.

Hospitality, so leading a feature in ancient monasticism, was developed in Hy in
the fulness of national generosity: hence, a large portion of Adamnan's aneedotes have
reference to the entertm'nment of strangers3 and the story of the heron
(91) serves as a lively illustration of the kind reception which was always Hospitalitas
in store for the visitor. When a stranger arrived, he was sometimes intro-
duced at once to ‘the abbot, by whom he was kissed (54, 61); sometimes the interview
was deferred (20, 1 57). Wthn an expected guest arrived, the abbot and bretliren went
to meet and welcome him (28, 59, 87). He was conducted to the oratoryg (24, 152,
168), and thanks returned for his safety. From this he was led to a lodging, Itospz'tt'eem
(61), and water prepared to wash his feeth (27). If the visitor happened to arrive on
an ordinary fust-day of the wcek, the fast was relaxeffl in his favour (5 5), consolatio
eibi (50) was allowed, and hc was said jejunationem solz-ere (55). Ahnsgiv'mg waslicld
in high esteem (132), and the. founder, on severa] occasions, befriended the poor (130,
154). An instance is recorded where valuable presentS, under the name of ‚venia (79),
were sent to a man in need (78). Itinerant beggars, who went about with wallets
(131), were not held in such esteem. The monastery was resorted to for medical relief
also (55). Grievous transgressors were exeluded (51).
