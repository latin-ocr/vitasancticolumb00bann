Summary qf St. Columba's Life.

lxix

7th of Decemberh is determined for an event, the dato of which might otherwise have
been unreeorded¹; and the Irish Calendarsi, in noticing it, present at that day, the
anomaly of a secular commemorationk. Authorities vary as to the year‘, ranging from
518 to 5²3 ; but calculation from Adamnan’s datam gives 52 1 as that most likely to bo

the t-rue period.

copy of his Life is preserved in one of the Ware
MSS. in the British Museum (Cod. Clar. 39, Add.
No. 4788), and it contains the soliowing passage:
“Sed et ipso sanctissimo die obitus sui de sancto
Columba spiritualiter vaticinans ait, Hodie, inquit,
natus est infans eui nomeu Columba, qui coram Deo
et hominibus gloriosus existet, quique post xxx¹a
annos abhinc huc veniet. et meum sepulcrum revela-
bit⁷ et cemiterium designabit” (sol. 73). The old
Irish Life of st. Columba contains exactly the
same statement. The Round Tower and majestic
crosses of Monasterboice are objects well known to
the antiquar-y.

¹¹ Seventlae ofDecember.—The Irish Life adds:
Oapomn Dm, nn cn ῑαόι metrumne, ¹ on Thurs-
day, ot* the weekhaysf
of517 and 523 for his birth: for, Dec. 7 is e, there-
fore, it being Thursday, A is the Sunday letter, which
belongs to the above years.

This will give the choice

'¹ Otherwise anre-corded—-In like manner, a syn-
«δι-01115111 rendered the birth—day of Alexander the
Great notorious.

J' Irt’sh Colendum—Madau German, at Dec. 7,
has 66111 01101111111 com eaerum, which Colgan
renders ⁴⁴ Nativitas S. Columbae immaculati et prce-
clari'‘ (Ti-ias Th. p. 483 a). The Calendar of Do-
negal has §ein Cotum-mne, ‘the Birth of
Columcille'

¹¹ Secular commemoration.—The Breviary of Aber-
deen thus limits the admission of such: ¹* Post illum
sacrosanctum domini nostri natalem diem nullius
hominis leg-imus nativitatem celebrari: nisi solum
beati iohannis baptiste: in aliis sanctis et electis
dei novimus 11111111 diem coli: qno illos post con-
summacionem laborum et devictum triumphatumque
mundum in perpetuas eternitates presens vita par-
tun'it.”-Pr0pr. SS. Part. Estiv. fol. 15 bb. Baert
observes on the present ease: ‘⁵ Verum, cum non
soleat Nativitas sanctorum festive celebrari, prae-

k

terquam B. Mariae Virginis et S. Joannis Baptista».
quia horum, et non aliorum Nativitas, sancta ct
immaculata ab omni peccato exstitit; crediderim hoc
potius memoriae cansa a Gormano insciiptum Mar-
tyrolog‘io fuisse, quam venerationis. ¹'—-Act. SS. J un.
tom. ii. p. 183 α.

¹ seam—The Annals of Ulster waver between
518 aud 52²- At the former date they say: “Na-
tivitas Coluimcille eodem die quo Bute mac Bronaigh
(101·1111ν11.;’1 at the latter, “Vel hic nativitas 001111111-
cille.” Tighernach places it in the same year with
the battle of Dema, and the year after the death of
Coulaedh, which was synchronous with the acces-
sion of Justin the elder, in 518. The Four Masters
fix St. Buite's death at 521. The Annals of 11113-
fanen have 51 1, and those of Boyle 499; but their
respective systems of computation are peculiar to
themselves. O'Donnell calculates 520 (iii. 57, Tr.
Th. p. 441 b). Ussher adopts 522 (Brit. Eccl. Ant.
Index Chronol.); Colgan, 5¹9 (Tr. Th. p. 486 (1):
while Dr. Lanigan fixes on 521 (Eccles. His-t. voi.
ii. pp. 106, 114). The statement in the Irish Life
gives 523 (note h, supra). Nennius has the follow-
ing chronological note: ¹¹ A nativitate Columbae
usque mortem sanctae Brigidae quatuor anni sunt¹¹
(Hist. Brit. ξ 16, ed. Stevenson). Unfortunately,
the exact date os St. Brigid's death is alike matter
of controversy.

mAdamnan's ‹iata—St. Columba was inhis forty- -
second year when he removed to Hy (Pref. 2, p. 9),
that is, in 563. In that year Whitsunday fen ou
the 13th of May, so that he was then 4¹ years,
5 months, and 6 days, oid. Add to this, 34 years
for his sojourn in Britain (ib. and pp. 227, 228),
and we get the date 597, so that the 9th of June in
that year found him 75 years, 6 months, and 2 days,
old. Thus, with the Four Masters and Dr. Lanigan,
we get 621 as the year of his birth. Budu's state-
ment is that St. Columba died cum esset armorum
