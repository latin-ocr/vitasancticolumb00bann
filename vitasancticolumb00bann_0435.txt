by the same king in 121 1-1 ²143 and substantially repeated in a confirmation¹² by King
Alexander II. in 1214-1218. In 1314 the convent grants to Malcolm of Monimusk
“ totam terram nostram de Forglen que pertinet ad Bracbennach cum omnibus perfin-
eneiis suis una cum jure patronatus ecclesie ejusdem terre ..... Dictus vero Mal-
eolmus ct heredes sui facient in exercitu 1101111111 Regis nomine nostro servicium pro
dicta terra quod pertinet ad Bracbennach quociens opus fuerit''⁰. From the Moni-
musks the lands of Forglen, with the custody of the Braebennaeh, passed by inheri-
tanee to the Urrys and the Frasers, in the latter of which families they were found in
1388. In 141 1 they were surrendered to the convent, and about 1420 they were eon-
ferred on Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum. In 1457 they had passed to his grandson,
who held them of the abbot and convent by 5611166 of ward and relies, and “ ferendi
vexillum de Brekbennaeh in exercitu Regis,” and the payment of the annual rent ot'
40 shfflingsv. In 1481 Alexander Irvine did homage for these lands and purtenances
to the abbot, who “dixit et constituit 111 tenentes regalitatis dicti monasterii de Aber-
brothoe ubicumque existentes 611111 dicto Alexandro ad exercitum domini nostri Regis
sub le Brecbennoch Videlicet sub vexillo dictorum abbatis et conventus meabunt et
equitabunt cum requisiti fuerint per dictum dominnm abbatem et conventum dicti mo-
nasterii et suos successores pro defensione Regis et regns’q. In 1483 Alexander 111-’1116
had a ehartcr of the lands of F orglen, with the advowson of the church “ faciendo 111
exercitu domini nostri Regis servicium de le Brekbannach debitum et consuotmnffi.
And lastly, in 1494 it was found that Alexander Irvine was the lawful heir of Alex·
ander Irvine of Dmm, his father, 111 the. lands of Forglen, with the advowson of the
church, held as above'. From these notices we leam that this reliquary was a banner,
and held so sacred in the beginning of the thirteenth century that it was named in the
dedication clause of the earliest charter. Also, that it was coupled with S. Columba’s
name, 1101 because the 1111116)Ν of Arbroath was under his invocation, for it was under
that of St. Thomas of szterbury3 nor because he was patron saint of the parish, for
St. Adamnant was reputed to be so; but, as we may conceive, because this 110111161- was
111 501116 way connected with St. Columba's history, either by use or blessing. Possibly
it was like the Vem’llum Sancti C'atlzbertz'u, 50 fatal to the Seots at N mlle's Cross.
“Ther did appeare to Johne Fossour, the Prior of the Abbey at Durham, a vision
commanding him to take the holie Corporax Cloth, which was within the eorporax,
