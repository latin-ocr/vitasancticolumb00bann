The words pro undecima arc difficult of explanation, but they were so at the time the
manuscript was written, for the scribe has placed in the margin opposite pro the mark
of obscurity. But whatever ambiguity may attend some words, it is plain that con-
ductio is employed to denote ‘ bringing together‚’ or ‘transfer'ffi as elsewhere, inthe
same manuscript, ¹ meeting,’ ‘ interview’l ; and that the passage expresses the belief
as existing‚ at the close of the eighth century, that the bones of Columkillem had, be—
fore that period, been brought to Ireland from Britain, aud deposited in Saul.

The same impression is conveyed in another but more legendary rccord, and seem-
ingly of a later date, which also supposes St. Columba's remains to have been conreyed
into the innermost part of Strangford Lough, in the county of Down, and merely dif-
fers in making Downpatrick the destination instead of the neighbouring church of
Saul. O'Donnell’s account of the matter is thus translated by Colgan: “Pro operis
hujus coronide (quod minime debuit silentio pertransiri) hic subjicio quomodo corpus
hujus S. Patriarchae in Monasterio Hiensi prius sepultum, fuerit in Hiberniam postea
translatum, et in codem sepulchro eum sacris exuviis Sanctorum Patricii et Brigidae
reconditum. . . . Sufficiat memorare modum et occasionem factae Translatiom's,

at p. 242, supra. His death is entered in the An.
Ult. at 845: Ferdomnach, sopiens, et scriba opti-
mus Ardmachae dormivit. How just this character
waS. the execution of the Book os Armagh‚ now
open before the writer, fully proves.

r Transfer.—The late ingenious archaeologist,
the Hon. Algemon Herbert, in a paper ‘⁴ On the
Peculiarities of Culdeism” (British Magum, vol.
xxvi. p. 249), has the following observation on this
passage: “It would seem, that Iona was to be the
seat of the last judgment3 for we read in Tirechan
that, eleven miles from the grave of St. Patrick, was
¹ the embarkation [conductio] of the mai-tyrs, or port
[ostium] of Columcille from Britain, and the em—
barkation of all the saints from Ireland at the day
of judgment! From Ireland to Ῑοπα, since Iona
alone was to be unsubmergedl‘ A comparison of
this passage with the genuine extract in the text
will show how easily an oriyinal authority may be
brought to bear any way one wishes, and will natu-

rally create distrust in a paradox founded on such
evidence. Saul is not two miles from Downpatrick.

¹²¹ Bones of columina—Thu the word ossuum
has been correctly assigned as a gloss to martirum
in the restoration proposed in the text, win bc seen
from the following enti-ies in the early Annals :—
734, Commutacio martirum Petair et PoiI et Pa-
druic ad quem perficiendam (Tigh., An. Ut.) 743,
Commutatio martirum Treno Cille Delqin(1bid.).
775, Commutatio martirum sancti Erce Slane; et
comotatio martirum Finniani Cluana-Iruird. (An.
Ult.) After A. D. 77 5, the Annals of Ulster employ
the term reliquiarum instead (784⁷ 789, 792, 793,
799, 800). Cathal Maguir, who compiled these
Annals, borrowed from a succession of original
chronicles, and the change in the terms probably
indicates a change of author. 'manerio is the ana-
logous Irish term, which is glossed by cuim in an
old MS. (H. 3, 18, p. 525, Trin. Con. Dubl.), or by
minna (H. 4, 22, p. 7). The pai-ish Kilnamartry,
siguifying ‘Church of the relies: derives its name
from the same word.
