ST. Cormffl’s history belongs to the period of the Irish Ohurch when the Secundus
Ordo of saints prevailed, and his name, with those of the Brendans, Comgall‚ aud
Cafflneeh, whom Adamnan reeords with honour as his special friends, appears in the
catalogue of its worthies. This Order may be regarded as the development of a native
ministry, whose system possessed more nationali‘cy than ‘that of their predecessore and
took a deeper inipress from the customs and condition of the country. Its characteris-
ties were: “Pauci episcopi, ct multi presbytem diversas missas celebrabant, et di-
versas regulas; unum Pascha nv. Luna3 unam tonsuram ab aure ad aurem, abnega-
bant mulierum administrationem, separantes eas a monasteiiis''³. The divorsity of
liturgical practice probably arose from the mixed character of the Primus Orda, Which
was composed of Romans, Francs, Britons, and Egyptians; and their conventual disei-

with great earnage around him.' This was proba-
bly the result of the expedition recorded in the Coi-
bert Chronicle of Innes: ‘¹ Cujus [Constantini]
tertio anno Normanui praedaverunt Dunealden om-
nemque Albaniau1.’⁷

h onim—The Four Masters briefly say: ‘⁵ Oitir
and the Foreigners went from Loch Dachaech to
Alba, and Constantine, the sou of Aedh, gave them
battle, and Oitir was siaiu, together with the Fo-
reigners who accompauied him.'' Loch Daehaech
was an old name for Waterford Harbour.

³ Monasteriis.-'rhe catalogue of the three orders
of Irish saints forms the groundwork of the latter
part of Ussher's Brit. Eeclr Antiqq. It was first
printed by him, and the various readings in his
notes show that he had more than one copy 3 but he
does not tell whence he derived them (Wks. vol. vi.
p. 477). A similar record, differ-ing in no material
point except the omission of some names, was

printed in Fleming's Collectanea, where it is stated
that the recital was “verba pervetusti et fidelis an-
thoris vitae S. Patricii ;” and further, ¹‘ quae totidem
fere verbis, regum tamen et Sanctorum praetermissis
vocabulis, leguntur in antiqua et fideli S. F inniani
vita, quae curu aliis plurium Sanctorum Hibemiae
Legendis, quas R. P. Franciscus Matthaeus, nunc

Minister nostrae Provinciae, circa annum 1626,
