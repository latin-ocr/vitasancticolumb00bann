time of Adamnan. He was the ninth abbot who succeeded to the government of Ia
after Cohuncille.

“A great spoil was carried off by the Saxons from Erin. Adamnan went to demand
a restitution of the spoil, as Bede relatos in his history. The greater part of the
bishops ofall Europe assemblcd to condemn Adamnan for having celebrated Easter
after the fashion of Columcffle‚ and for having upon him the tonsure of Simon Magus,
i.e. ab aure ad aurem. Bede saysg that though many were the wise men in that synod,
Adamnan excelled them all in wisdom and eloquence3 and Adamnan said, 1t was not 'm
imitation of Simon Magus that he had this tonsure, but in imitation of John of the
Breast¹¹‚ the foster-son of the Redeemcr, and that this was the tonsure which he had
upon him, and that though Peter loved the Saviour, the Saviour loved John ; and that
it was on the fourteenth of the moon of April, on whatever day ot* the week that should
fan, the Apostles celebrated Easter. Then an old senior rising up said, Though Co-
lumcille himself were present here, we would not leave him until he should be of the
same rulo with oursclves; but you wc wffl not quit, until you be of the samo rule
with ourselves. Adamnan made answer unto him and said, 1 shall be of the same rule
with you. Be tonsured. therefore, accordingly, said the bishops. It will be sufficient

Adamnan was then tonsured, and no greater honour was ever shown to man than was
given to Adamnan on this occasion ; and that great spoil was restored to him, and hc
cume straight home to his own monastery of Ia. It was a great surprise to his eon-
gregation to sce him with that tonsure. He then requested of the congregation to
receive the tonsure, but they refused, und he got nothing from them, sed Deus permisit

Beda dixin· for Bede was along with Adamnan. Now Adamnan came afterwards to
Erin, and hjs fame spread throughout the land, but that one regulation of Easter and
of the tonsure was not received from hini until this year, anno Domjni 696, and Adam-
nan ‹h'ed in the year 703, in the 78th year of his age.”

Bede reeords the last stage in our saint’s life, “ Qui cum celebrato in Hibernia ca-
nonico paseha, ad suam insulam revertisset, suoque monasterio catholicam temporis
paschalis observantiam instantissime praedicaret, nec tamen perficere quod conabatur
