daremur dies, ad Saineam devenimus insulam& ibidemque demoratos festiva
sancti Columbae nox¹ et solemnis dies nos invenit valde tristificatos, videlicet
desiderantes eandem diem in Ioua facere laetificam insula. Unde sicut prius

was in Colgan's possession3 but he has done no
more than make a few allusions to it, which is
the less to be regretted as the document is sor·
tunaoely preserved at Brussels‚ Burgund. Libr.
No. 23²4· He states that the acts were intituled
Cain Adlzamnain, that iS, Canens of Adamnan
(Act. SS. p. 382), from which it is probable that
they were the same as the eight Canens bear-
ing· Adamnan's name which have been printed
by Martene (Thesaur. Nov. Anecd. tom. iv.
col. 18), and are also in a MS. in Marsh's Li-
brary, Dublin, called Precedents of the See of
Armagh (p. 395), where they are intituled
canones Adomnani, into which they were co-
pied from a MS. of Sir R. Cotton. Of the sub-
scribing members Colgan has preserved the
following names 2—1. Aidus, Episcopus Slep-
tensis (Tr. Th. p. 218 a). 2. Colga filius
Moenaigh, Abbas Luscanensis (Act. SS. p
382). 3. Mosacer, Abbas (Ιὸ. p.454c1). 4. Kil-
lenus filius Lubnei, Abbas Sagirensis (lb. p.
473 b). 5. Mochouna, Antistes Dor-ensis (lb.
p. 566 a; Tr. Th. p. 503 a). 6. Eebertus, An-
glus (Act. SS. p. 604 a). These acts were not
dated, and though Colgan generally assigns
them to the year 695, he is undecided between
it aud 694, 696, or 697. The topographical
history of Tara Hm also reem-ds a synod at
which Adamnan presided. Close to the wall
of Tara chin-chyam, on the west, are the
traces of an earthen enclosure anciently called
the Ruit nu Senem, ⁴ Rath of the Synods‚’
within which the Dinnseanehus places the
Lucrino Dupcull Goomnmn, ‘the site of the
Tent of Adamuan’ (Pennas Tara, pp. 115,
151). Here, according to an ancient poem,
was held——

1rgalaeh, surnamed Ua Conaing, seems to have
been a neighbouring chief. He is mentioned
by Tighernach at 7015 and at 702 he was
slain on luis-mic-Nesan by the Britons. (Ann.
Ult. 701.) It may have been on this occasion
that Adamnan procured the enactment of a
law prohibiting women from taking part in
saction fights, which was called, from him, the
Cain Gomnnmn, ⁶ Law of Adamnan‚’ cen no

we have not a. more historical account of the
institution of this law than the following, which
is taken from the Leabhar Bmac, and Book ot
Leean: ‘¹ Adamuan happened to be travelling
one day through the plain of Bregia with his
mother on his back, when they saw two armies
engaged in mutual conffict. It happened then
that Bonan, the mother ofAdamuan, obser-ved
a woman, with an irou 1·eaping*hool‹ in hel·
hand. dragging another woman out of the op-
posite battalion with the hook sastened in one
of her breasts. For men and women went
equally to battle at that time. After this Ro-
nait sat down, and said= Thou shalt not take
me from this spot until thou exemptest women
for ever from being in this condition, and from
excursione and hostingS. Adamnan theu pro-
mised that thing. There happened afterwards
a convention [mopofflL] in Ireland, and Adam-
nan, with the principa] part of the clergy of
helmd, went to that assembly, and he ex-
empted the women at it.” (Petrie's Tara, p.
¹47·) It is possible also that Adamnan, in his
exertions to promote the observance of the
