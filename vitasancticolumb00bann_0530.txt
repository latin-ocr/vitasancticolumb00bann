1. Tobhsar odhram, ‘ Oran's Well,’ a little east of the Free Chureh manse.
z. Tobar Cheathaz'm near the Cathedral, celebrated in Gaelic verse.

The Lochan Mor, already mentioned, was a sheet of water, partly arfificial, cover-
ing an area about 400 yards by 200, lying between the mound and the base of Dunii.
Pennant, speaking of the mill, says :—“ The lake or pool that ser-ved it lay behind ; is
now draincd, and is the turbary, the fuel of the natives: it appears to have been once
‹lix-ided, for along the middle runs a raised way, pointing to the hills'’ (111. p. 2 58).
This causeway is called Iomaire-an-tachm'r, ‘ridge of the way,’ and sometimes the
Bc'slzop's Walk. It is 220 yards long, and about 22 feet wide. The tradition is that
this road was planted on both sides, and that “ the edges of the pond were all planted'’
(Old. Stat. Acct. xix: p. 203). Another little sheet of water is in Staonaig, in the
south of the island, and takes its name Loclz Staonaz'q, from the district where it is sit-uate.
