Comma-How can I be here, said he,

Thou noble son of Fedhlimg,
Among the powerful northern tribes,
In this border territory, O Colum ⁸?

(¹0Iwncz'lle.—Restrain all subordinates, 311 rash ones,

An offiestains, who require it;
And I will restrain all actual kingS,
An those present and at a distance.

Let us therefore form our union,
As Christ has ordained, in the flesh3
Not to be dissolved till the judgment-day‚
By us, O Comae, offspfing of Liathan.

Bind upon the thumbsh of my hands,
Ο Comme of many dignifics,
The coils of our noble union,

As long as beautiful-coloured Dairmagh shall last.

Perverse-15 hast thou attaeked me,
If it be not m'fled by the King of heaven;
Thou hast taken off from me all my thumb,
Ο good saint, O good man.

Sharply hast thou attaeked me, O Momoniaui.
O Cormae, of memorable sense;
W'olves shall eat thy body,
For this deed, without any merey.

Cornme.—Though many be the joints of my body,

Said (ἴοι-11130 the just, from Corc‘s Cashel¹‘‚
There shau be a ehurch for every one of them,
And they shall all be yours, O fair-famed Colum.

columina—I well know what will be the result
Of cutting me, of mutilating me:

Mine honour shall rest with my thumh in my churoh,
As long as pointed Erin shall exist.
