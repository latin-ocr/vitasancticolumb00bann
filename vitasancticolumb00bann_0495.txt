fridus strabus, twelfth abbot of Augia Divestv, who flourished between 823 and 849, has written
a poem of 172 hexameters on the martyrdom of this ecclesiastic. He describes Blaithmaic as
“regali de stirpe satus,'‘ as “regius haeres‚'' and as “rex ille futurus, genuit quem dive< Hi-
bernia mundo.'’ He states that, having become a monk‚ “agmina multorum rexit veneranda
virorum ;'' aud that. subsequently, coveting the crown ot* martyrdom, he betook himself to the
island of Eo, whither the pagan Danes had already on more than one occasion come. Expecting
their return, he counselled the memhers of the fraternity to save themselves by flight3 whereupon
some departed, while others remained with him. The precious shrine containing St. Columba‘s
relies he deposited 111 the earth⁷ aud when, on the arrival of the plunderers, he refused to make

known the place of its coneealment, they slew both him and his companions. This poem was

first printed by Canisius, and has since been frequently reproduced (315).

*Auyia Divom—It. 15 a remarkable coincidence
that this monastery (now Reichenau) should furnish
the only narrative ot* St. Blaithmac‘s martyrdom,
and be the depository of the oldest manuscript of
Adamnan. Its familiarity with the ecclesiasticen
affairs of the far west is accounted sor by the fact
that this abbey was originally an Irish foundation.
Before its suppression, iu 1799, it contained many
Irish MSS, and St. Findan's bowl is still preserved
in the saeristy. This saint is the Fiuntann os Lem-
clmille who is commemorated in the Irish (3818111131-
at Nov. 16, and whose name occurs in the Ne-
crologium of Reichenau at the same day, ‘⁴ xvi. KJ.
Dec. findan Scott11s.”

¹ Aidum.—This was Aedh Oirdnidhe, monarch
of Ireland. His excommunication, which is de-
signedly omitted by the Four Masters, may have
been for his invasion of Tirconnell in 815, or be-
cause he was privy to Maelduin’s death. He is said

to have made a royal decree in 804, excusing cccle-
siastics from military service. Tam, it is to be
observed, was occasionally resorted to as an ecclesi-
astical station, even after it had ceased to be inhab-
ited. See An. Ult. 779, and p. 179, supra.

5 Blaithmaci.-The name, which is a common
0118, is derived from blsse,flos, und umc‚filizc.r‚ and,
as Colgan observes, may be latinized ΙΓΙῡιἼζιμηιιιεἼ or
Florentius (Act. SS. p. 129 b). The Index of the
Calendar of Donegal represents it by Flnzriyenius
and Florus, as it does btuch by Flora. Wala-
fridus Strabus paraphrases the name by Pulcher
natus. sumaimmac's day is commemorated abroatl
on the 19th ot* January (Colg. Act. SS. p. 127), but
the 1n‘sh Calendar places his day at July 24.

² Tuatlzal mac Feradhaiclz.—Abbot of Rechra
and Durrow (an. 850, infra). Hence the associa-
tion of his name with Adamnan's shrine.
