ΤΗΕ expression cegjuss monasteria, as applied to St. Columba, is not limited to the
churches which were founded by him in person, but includes all those which, down to
the writer's time, were established by Columbian monks, or professed subjection to the
mother church of Hy. Hence it is likely that many monasten'es, which in the scvcnth
and eighth centurics might bc elassed under the above title, ceased in after times to bear
any trace of their original relation, and became distinguished only by the names of the
immediate founders, under whose patronage they were built. St. Doehonna's ehureh,
for instance, was probably at first subject to Hy, though afterwards indepmdent, when
known as St. Machar's of Aberdeen. The following catalogue of Columbian founda-
tions in Sootland admits of considerable enlargement, but it is sufficient to show how
widely the veneration of St. Columba was extended in his adopted country :—

the names of several hish saints are associated with places in the island, although the
chief founder has no longer any local commemoration therein.
