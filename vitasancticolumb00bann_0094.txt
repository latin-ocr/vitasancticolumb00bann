Fedhhmidh=‚ the father of Columba, belonged to the clan⁰ which occupied, and
gave name to, the territory surround'mg Gai-tan, and was, moreover, a member of the
reigning familiesv of Ireland and British Dalriada. Eithneq, the mother of Columba,
was of Leinstcr extraction‘, {md deseended fi'om an illustrious provincial king. Thus
the nobiljty of two raccs was combined in their son, and, no doubt, contributed to the
extended influence which hc acquired, When education, picty, and zeal were supcr—

added to his honourable antecedents.

He was baptized by the presbyter Cruitlmeoliam, under thc namc Colum‘, to which
the addition of cille, signifying ‘ of thc chureh’==‚ was subsequently made, in reference

ceptuayinta septem (H. E. iii. 4), which is followed
by Tighernach. The old Irish Life, and O’Donuell‚
roser his birth to 520; but the Annals os Ulster
give 76 years as his age.

¹! Emtae—See Pref. 2, p. 8, infra, aud pp. 190,
246. This was a common name. The mothers of
Bishop Aedh, os St. Maedoc of Ferns, and of St.
Comgan of menn-nissen, were so called. The Irish
Calendar records the names of Eithne⁷ daughter of
Maine, who was commemorated on the east of the
Boyne; and Eithue, daughter of Dunlaing, who
was patron of Tulach-Ui-Felimidhn(Sene-has Nacmlz
in Book of Lecan). See also the six examples in the
Index to O'Donovan's Four Masters. Doire-Eithue
was the original name of Cili-mac-Neuain.

Γ Leinsler euronium—See her pedigree and fa-
mily history at pp. 8, 163, 164, 246, infra. The
legend of king Aedh mac Ainmirech’s death in the
Book of Lecau (referred to in note Γ, p. 39, infra),
contains a dialogue between the king and St. Co-
lumba, os which the following is a translation: ‘¹ O
cleric, said the king, obtain for mc from the Lot-d
that my trophy [i. e. my head οι· scalp] be not
gained by the Leinstermen. That is difficolt for
me, said Colamcille, because my mother is of then13
and they came to meto Durrow, and by fasting

urged me to bcstow the gift of a sister's son. And
what they requesoed of me was that their trophies
should not be carried off by a sti-anger king. And
Ι promised them that.'' Noe, or Naue as Adamnan
calls it (p. 9), the name of Eithne's grandfather, is
common iu Irish records. See An. Ult. 674, 710,
7893 and Rath-Noe, p. 87, infra.

¹² Of tlte dunch—Not clmrclaes, sor then the
name would be Colum nu 5-cedll.. Bede rightly
derives Columcelli “a cella et Columba‘⁷ (H. E.
v. 9). So O'Donnell, as translated by Colgan.
“additameuto hille, quod cellum seu ecclesiam sig-
nificatvy (i. 30, Tr. Th. p. 393 b); ‘⁴ pax-tim ab Ec-
clesia, foelici omine, sortiturus‘⁷ (i. 8, ib. 390 b);
¹² pueri solebant prte gaudio, elevatis in coelum ma-
nibus, dicere, Ecce advenitColumba de cella''(O'Don-
nell ap. Colgan, Act. SS. p. 645 b). ln the Leabhar
Breac, we find the following rationale of the com-

of his coming from the cell in which hc read his
psalms, to meet the neighbouring children. And
what they used to say among themselves was, Has
our little Colum come to-day from the cell, i. e. from
Tulach-Dubhglaise in Tit-Lughdech in Cinell Co-
