Libren‘, Senan, comely confflem,
The 5011 of Ua Chein'¹, and 1115 brother,
Are the four, besides the others,
Who shall arrive at this place.
They are the seven pillars,
And they are 1110 seven ehiefs,
Whom God has surely commanded
To dwell in the same abode.

The original ehureh was called the Dublc-rqqles, ‘ Black-ehureh,’ to which there 15 re-
ference in the ancient 111105 cited by Tighernach :—

He passed to angele from 1115 body,
After seven years [and] seventy.

Thjs 01111ῑο11, like the Sablzall at Saul and Armagh, 15 recorded to have stood north

and south3 and the remains of it, which existed 111 1520, were referred to by O‘Don-
nell in proof of the. factm. In the fourteenth century it was called the Cella ivs-qm (ῖο
Βενῑἀ“, Its Round Tower was standing in the seventeenth 0011111151, but the only local
record of its existence now remaining is the name of the lane which leads to its site,
the Lonq Steeple. It is deserving of notice that F iachadh, 5011 of Ciaran, son of Ain-
mire, son of Sedua, whose death 15 recorded hy Tighernaeh at 620, is described by 111(-
annalist as alius fundatorum Daz're C'alqaz‘elz. He was nephew of Aedh, 5011 0111111111110,
the reputed founder. This cntry, and the authorities cited at p. 160, supra, are suffi-
cient to vindicate O'Donnell's statements, coneerniug the donation of Deny, from the
objections urged 111 the Ordnanee Memoix of Templemorcffl. This admirable work, how-
