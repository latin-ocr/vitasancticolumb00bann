Preface. xxvii

Marie pt sancti Cor-b. Frisinyensis, records the name of St, Corbinianus‘, the
founder of the see, who lived in the year 710.

VI. Codex S. A small quarto manuscript- on vellum, of the early part of
the ninth century, preserved in the Library of St. Gall, No. 5 ς 5. It consists
of 83 folios, and contains the text of the shorter recension. The writing,
which is represented in Plate IV . No. 2, is poor, and, as Dean Greith states,
“literis Carolinis saec. ix. scriptus, mendis et naevis scatet, ideoque plurimis
in locis correctus apparet.‘’ On the last page is the figure of St. Columba, of
which a facsimile is given in Plate V. The catalogue of the library of St.
Gall, which was written in the ninth century, and is still preserved, mentions
a Vita sancti Colmnhae in Cod. i. ; and in a much later catalogue, that of
Weidmann, formerly librarian of St. Gall, that Vita is reported to be still in
existence. Haencl says of it: “ Vita S. Columbae cod. membranaceus, pul-
chre scriptus. In fine imago S. Columbae. Reperitur in catalogo Bibliothecae
saec. ix.'' (Catalogi Libror. MSS. ἀφ, col. 697, Lips. 1830). For the various
readings of this manuscript, the editor is indebted to the Very Rev. Charlcs
Greith, Dean of St. Gall.

VII. Codex Cottonianus. This copy of the Life is contained in a large
folio volume, which formerly belonged to Sir Robert Cotton, and is now to
be found in the British BIuscum, under the mark Bihl. Cotton. Tiberias,
D. iii. It is a vellum manuscript in double columns, written in a fine large
hand, of the latter part os the twelfth century. It contained, according to
Smith⁵, sixty—eight tracts, principally Lives of Saints3 and, among these, the
forty-seventh was Vita Sancti Columbe episcopi. With other manuscripts os
the Cotton Library, it suffered considerable damage in the fire 0f1731‚ and
from that time until 18 52 was unernployed, being reported in the Catalogue‘
as ‘⁵ A folio volume on vellum, burnt ‘to a crust‚ which is preserved in a case.’‘
However, by the direction of Sir Frederick Maddenu, and under his judicious
superintendence, the leaves which had been consolidated were disengaged‚
flattened‚ and inlaid, and the volume once more made available sor refer-
ence. Unfortunately‚ the editor was not aware of the existence of this
manuscript at the time that he was collating the other copies, so that its
