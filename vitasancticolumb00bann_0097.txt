generally the fifteen years' interval between 546 and 562 for their foundation.

In 561 was fought the battle of Cooldrevnyv, which is believed to have been, in a
great measure, brought about at St. Colmuba’s instigation. A synod, which Adamnan

latter of which names is a clerical error for Macc-
u-telduib. The designation is derived from Ailill
Telduib, a progenitor of the saint. The tract De
Manibus SS, Hib.‚ attributed to AEnguS, calls St.
Finniau, “ Findia, son of Ui·Tellduib.'’ A succes-

Annals at 653, is styled ‘⁴ Colman Mac Ua Tel-
