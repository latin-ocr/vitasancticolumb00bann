hood was probably Seghinev, sor he lived until Adamnan was twenty-eight years old.
During his ineumbency, and that of the three succeeding abbots, our author, no doubt,
acquired such a character as rendered him eligible‚ and such a reputation for learning
as recommended him, to the presidency of the Columbian order, now in the meridiam
of celebrity and influenee. With the exception of his skill in Latin, his acquaintance
with other languages and branches of education is more a subject of infereneew than of
express declaration ; there is sufficient evidence, however, to justify Ward¹ in the
statement: “ Edoetus est omnes liberales, sacras et aseeticas disciplinas, linguas etiam
Hebraicam et Graeeam; et quidquid patria linguai (in qua tum plermque scientiae et
Druydmn quae non fuere damnata dogmata) scriptum esset vel artium, vel legum, vel
histon'arumss' His studies, meanwhile, did not super-sede his bodfly labours, and
to the subordinate period of his profession is probably to be referred ‘the voyage for

made so conspicuous a figure during Finnachta’s reign.

‘¹ Inference.—Besides the introduction of Greek
words into the text of the lise, he discusses the or-
thography aud meaning of some Greek names in
the tract De Locis Sanctis, ii. 27, iii. 23 and treats
of the Hebrew form of Tyre, ond its Latin equiva-
lent, and the mention os the name in historical

writers, as if such subjeets were familiar to him.
