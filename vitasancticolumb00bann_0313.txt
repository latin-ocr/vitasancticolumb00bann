as a fit opportunity occurred, and have been on
that account often praised by Bede. It can
scarcely be doubted, that they were the instru-
ments used by the Almighty sor the conversion
of those early Anglo-Saxon Christians in Co-
lumba’s time; and that, with regard to a part
of that nation, they got the start of the Roman
missionaries in the blessed work of bringing
them over to the Christian faith.'’—Lanigan,
Eccles. Hist. ii. p. 174.

ὓ Piston—The corrupt reading pictor in Col-
gan and the Bollandists has been productive
of opposite results. On the one hand, it bas
afforded to the admirers of ancient Irish art a
supposed evidence of its cultivation in Hy (see
Dr. F. Keller's Bilder und Schriftziiye in den
irisclzen Mmuscripten, p. 73, where Westwood’s
Paloeoqraphia Sacra is cited) ς and, on the
other, it suggested to the half-informed Dr.
John Smith the notion that it was a wilsu] per-
version of the text, to serve religious ends.

Gueren‚ a Saxom and a Saxon bak-er, or pistor
(Edit Pinkert.)‚ which the editions ofthe Bol-
landines, Colgan‚ and other Catholics2 have
printed pictor. But as Columba had no images,
he had no occasion for a painter.‘'-Life of St.
Columba, p. 115. This statement is ful] os
blunders ; less ssippancy and more learning
would have excused other Cudzoh'cs, for Cani-
sius and Messingham read pistor. The joint
error in Colgan and the Acta Sanctorum arose
from the use of a common manuscript, Stephen
White's transcript of Cod. A., which probably
contained the inem-rect reading. Colgan's
abridged version of O'Donnell has pictor, ii. 26
(Tr. Th. p. 413 b); so has the Vita Secunda,
from the eod. Salmanticensis, c. 24 (Tr. Th.
p. 328 a). possibly in these places Colgan has
ventured on an imagined emendation.
