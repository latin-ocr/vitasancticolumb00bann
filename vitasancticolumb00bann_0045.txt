Preface. xxv

Trivetz' super Regula beati Azcyustiizi, fol. 79 a to 144 h. The leaf measures
9} by 6} inches, and the page 63} by 4} inehes. There are generally 24 lines
to the page. The age of the manuscript has been greatly overrated. Pinker-
ton⁷ in his Vitae Antiquae⁶‚ states it to be Ceut. scii„ and is followed by Dr.
Petrie (215). In his Enquirgf, Pinkerton lowers the date one century, and
describes it as ‘⁴ written in the thirteenth century.’'

III. Codex C. The Canisian text, which was published in 1604, ‘⁶ ex
membranis m. s. Monasterii WVindbergensis in Bauaria.” It sccms to be the
manuscript which is mentioned, under the head ll'indbery in the Appendix As
to the Report of the English Rccord Commissiooers, as S. Adamnanus Scolus
de S. Columba Scoto. In its printed state, this is the most unsatisfactory
textg of all the copies ε it is very likely, however, that justice has not been done
to it in the transcription. It belongs to the shorter recension. In the intro-
duction to the Life, Canisius says: “ Notandum est quod codex MS. Rebdorf-
sensis expresse in titulo libri vocat Sanctum ;'’ and Messinghamh cites him as
his authority for the statement: ‘⁵ Codex M S. Rebdorfensis ubique vocat
Adamnanum, vel Adomnanum.” But this is another namei for the Wind-
berg MS„ and the town of Rebdors is situate in the south-east of Framonia,
a little west of Eichstadti, on the north bank of the Altmuhl, a tributary of
the Danube. Canisius's residcnce and place of publication, Ingolstadtk, is not
far off on the south-east.

IV. Codex D. The second tract (fol. 39 aa to 51 ba), in a large vellum
manuscript of the thirteenth century, preserved in Primate Marsh‘s Library‚
Dublin, vulgarly, though erroneously, called the Book osz‘lkenny¹, and marked
