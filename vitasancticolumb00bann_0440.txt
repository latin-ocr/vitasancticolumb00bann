by the extinction of conrentual observance, and the virtual transfer of the endowments
to lay possession, as in Bangord, or by the repetition of irregularities such as St. Ber-
nard complains of 'm the case of Armagh².

These &mh-centumr monasteries were as rapid in their growth as they were numer-
ous in their crcation. st. Finnian's of Clonard is said to have numbered 3000 mem-
ber-ss, St. Comgall's of Bangor the same amount, and St. Brendan’s parochias 3000 more.
The ramjfioafions of these houscs spread exactly in the same manner as St. Columba’s,
and, for a time, were fully equal in extent to his; but they wanted the severalty of
position which the Columbian centre enjoyed3 they had no Pictish racc to convert;
and, above all, thoy had no Adaman to perpetuate the honours of their founders.

Whethcr St. Columba or any of his contemporaries composed and promulgated a
systematic rulo like St. Bencdict's is very doubtful. Rcyner expressed his opinion in
the negativeh: and though Fleming and O⁷C0nor have condemned him for the asser-
tion, they have failed in prox-ing thc affimative of the question. Wflffid, indeed,
spoke at the synod of Whitby of refflcla cte proecqn‘a of Columbse, and in the Lives of
some of the Irish saints tho term o-eyzda orcum, but generally in the sense of ‘ disci-

former omitting to keep up the succes-sion of the
latter. In such case the tenant in possession might
maintain a semblauee of the clerica! character by
taking the tonsure aud a low degree of orders. This
is very much what Giralilus Cambrensis states con-
reruing the Abbates laici of Ireland aud Waies (Iti-
nerar. Cambr. ii. 4). The so-called Canons os St.
Patrick recnguise the relation os the “clericus et
uxor ejus'' (can. 6) ς and Pope Gregory, in 601, pre-
scribed for St. Augustine„ ‘⁶ Si qui vero sunt clerici
extra sacros ordines constituti, qui se continere non
possunt. sortiri uxores debent, et stipendia sua ex-
terius accipere” (node, H. E. i. 27).

In monastic
language a parochia was the jurisdiction of a Su-

Cogitosus says of St. Brigid: “cujus parrochia per
totam Hiberniensem terram diffusa'* (Pr01.‚ Tr. Th.
p. 5 18). St. Brendan ‘⁴ cum venit de navigio suo quae-
rendo terram repromissionis sanctorum, tunc parro-
chia ejus per diversas regiones Hybernie dilatata est '¹
(Cod. Marsh. fol. 57 b α). St. Ciaran was styled
“Leath nEirinn, i. e. ‘dimidium Hibemiae,’ par-
ochia enim ejus per medium Hyberniae dilatabitur''
(ib. fol. 146 aa); and his influence was so great
that ‘¹ valde enim parochiam Hiberniae apprehende-
ret'' (ib. sol. 147 bb).
