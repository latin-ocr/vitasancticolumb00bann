AL1o in tempore, quidam ²Hiberniensis peregrinus ad Sanctum perve-
niens, per aliquot apud eum menses in ³10ua ⁴¹commanebat insula. Cui vir
beatus alia die, Nunc, ait, quidam de ⁶provincialibus ⁷tujs clericis ad coelum
ab angelis portatur, eujus adhuc ignoro nomen. Frater vero hoc audiens
coepit secum de Β provincia perscrutari Anteriorum³‚ ⁹qui Scotice ¹⁰Indairthir¹³

intulit verbum, ¹³inquiens‚ Alium Christi scio ¹⁴militonem qui sibi in eodem
territorio, in quo et ego commanebam, ¹⁵monasteriolum construxit, nomine

the principal, and now only cemetery in Hy is
called the Reiliy Orain, after him instead of the
patron saint, and has been so for many centu-
ries3 for iu the gloss to the Feilire of AEnguS‚
at St. Otihran's commemoration. Oct. 27, it is
observed‚ 0111 Choicum eiue ,1. neno Οῦῃωη,
¹ of Hy Colaim-eille, .1. of Relic Odhrain.' Pro-
bably Odhran was the first of St. Columba’s fra-
ternity who was interred in the island. 31111 the
whole island being called after the patron, the
cemetery took its name from the first kinsman
of his eommunity who was buried iu it. The
story 11311 not lost in its carriage when it was
told to Pennant, and the late. Hon. A. Herbert
has revived it in a way which will surprise if it
does not convince. See his Peculiarities 11]οιιῖ-
deism, British Magazine, vol. xxvi. p. 103 Irish
Nennius, p. xxv. See also the drawings of St.
Oran's chapel, a building of the twelfth cen-
tury, but the oldest now remaining in the island,
and os the Reilig, in Graham's Antiqq. of Iona,
plates 5, 6 (Lond. 1850).

³ [interiorum—Equivalent to Orientalium.
See the note on the word, i. 43 (p. 82)

b Indairthir.-—This word is compounded of
unz), an old form of the article in the nom. plu-
ral, which is usually joined to its noun (see
Zeuss, Gram. Celt. i. pp. 230, 237 3 O'Donovan‚
Ir.Gr‚ p. 67), and Clmchm, ‘Easterns.' Some-
times it appears in the early Annals 111 the form
nt] nGmchen, and sometimes, as An. Flt. 640,
in its equivalent Latin orientales. R] nu 110111-
chm, of Tigh. 722, is rex Orientalium in An.
Ult. 72¹· Thus in the Tripartite Life of St.
Patrick, Oirtlu'r, id est Orientalis‚ iii. 7¹ (Tr.
Th. p. 162 b). The people were so called, as
inhabiting oineeon Οιῃδιοῑῑ, Eas! Oriel (Four
Mast. ¹099)· See the note, p. 83, supra.

ε Diormitium.—Not expressly notit-ed in the
calendars. Colgan conjectured that he was
“Diarmait, son of Meachar, bishop of Airlher-
magh in Tuath-ratha,” who is commemorated
at Jan. 16; but incorrectly, for Tuath-ratha is
now called Toora. and is part of the barony
of Magheraboy, in the county of Fermanagh;
