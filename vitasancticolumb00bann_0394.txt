once the residenee of the monks of Ionam. And a visitor of more recent date observes:
“A water-spring at the head of a narrow creek in the adjacent shore is called St. Co-
lumba’s Well;¹' adding, what seems an imported tradition, that a little pile on the
summit of a ncighbouring height was said to be ‘¹ the tomb of AEthnea, mother of the
111115111005 saint'’¹³. The adjacent island is called. Culbrandon, i. e. Secessus Brendani.

3. Locn commum—On the north-west of the pai-ish of Kilmuir, in the island
' of Skyo. See the description of its monastic remains at p. 138, supra. The particu-
lars of its draining are to be found in the N ew Stutistical Account, vol. xiv. pt. 1,
pp. 246, 267, 279. It may be a question whether the island of Skye belonged to 1110
Picts or to the Scots in St. Columba's time: the ancedote told in 1. 33 (p. 62) supra,
5001115 111 favour of the former. Tighcrnach, at 668 (An. Ult. 667), records 1110 *Most*-
qatz'o filiorum Goertnaith ad fflberm'am cum plebe Scit& and at 670 (An. Ult. 669),
Venit Gens Garmaz't de Hibernia,- where Scilla probably (10110105 Skye. 10 this case
the filii Gay-tnaz't may have been the fiimily of Gartnait, the youngest son of King
AEdan, who had occupied the island ε but 11115 is not likely, as the Cinel Gabhrain, to
which they belonged, were the most southern 50111015 os the Scotic colony. Thcfiliz'
Gartnait were rather the sons of Gartnait mac Uuid, the Pictish king in 636. or of his
successor Gartnait mac Domhnall, who died in 663. In 11115 ease the change of settle-
ment, in 668, may have been caused by Seotic oceupation. However, when Adamnan
wrote, the mountain of the Dorsum Britannice being considered the bou'ndary line, the
islands on the west would necessarily fall to the Scots. Hence the legend of St. Com-
gan in 1110 Abel-deon Breviary states that 1110 adjacent parish on the mainland of
Locheleh [now Loehalsh] was in Erchadia boriali& or North Argyle.

4. Prieni-ennum-—Of this island, which lies N. W. of the extreme north point
ef Skye, Martin writes: “Fladda (Iluam (1. e.) F (adda of the Ocean, lies about two
