EODEM tempore Sanetus, et in eodem loco, ad ²Scandlanum‚ filium Col-

land at this period. Of the twelve successions
which took place between the birth ofst. Co-
lumba and the reign of this Domhnall, only two
were unatteuded by violence. His obit, as re-
corded by the Four Mastem, is in strict accord-
ance with the biographer's statement: A. C.
639 [recte 64z], ‘¹ After Domhnall, son of Aedh,
son of Ainmire, had been 16 years in the sove-
reiguty os Ireland, he died at Ard-Fothadh‚ in
'rir Aedha, after the victory of penance, for he
was a year in his moi-tal siekness3 and he used
to receive the body of Christ every Sunday.¹'
(Vol. i. p. 257. Ed. O'Donov.) The latter par-t
of this eutry seems to be horrowed from a pas-
sage in the ancient preface to the Ambra rela-
tive to St. Columba’s conduct at Druimceatt:
¹* The Cleric went then to the assemblage of
Domhnall son of Aedh. And Domhnall rose
immediately before him, and bade him welcome,
and kissed his cheek‚ and set him down in his
own place. And the Cleric left many blessings
on him, viz., to be ten years in the sovereignty
of Ireland; and victory in battle during that
time3 and to fulfil one out of every seven os his
promises ; to be a year and a halfin the disease
of which he should die3 and to receive the body
of Christ every Sunday during that time-'’—
(MS. Trin. Coll. Dub. H. ii. 16, p. 681.) The
same passage occurs also in the sequel to the
Irish Life of St. Columba contained in the
Highland Society's MS. fol. 12 a b. The terri-
tory, previously called sereth, was named from
his father Tir-Aedha, now Tirhugh. the ex·

treme barony of Doncgall ou the south-west.
Here, in the parish of Drumhome, and town-
land of Ballymagrorty Irish, is a conica} hill,
locally known by the name Rumon, the apex of
which is entrenched like a rath, and contains
an ancient cemetery, now used only for the iu-
terment of unbaptized children. This is the
“Rath-nunqu in campo Sereth'' of Tirechan.
(Lib. Armac. fols. 1 ι b b, ¹5 α b.) Beside this
was the regal abode of DomhualL as appears
from a statement in the Tripartite Life of St.
Patrick: ⁴¹ Pergens postea Patricius per Tir-
conalliam, itinere iuter Eas-Ruaid [hodie Bal-
lyshanuon] et Oceanum suscepto, venit ad lo-
cum cui vocabulum Rath-cunya .· ibique a
fundamentis Ecclesiam excitavit . . . . In
colle vicino Ardjoffladlz appellato⁷ ccepit etiam
jacere fundamenta Ecclesiae. Sed die sequenti.
inchoata fabrica coepit corruere, et pene tota
corruit. Tunc vir Dei in spiritu vidit juxta
divinae praeordinationis dispositionem, locum
non esse a Deo destinatum, ad aedem sacram.
sed ad aulam regiam in eo extruendam. Prae-
vidit enim celebrem illum Hiberniae regem,
Domnaldum, Aido Ainmirii filio natum, post
tempora iu eo loeo sedem fixurum.”-ii. ιιι,
