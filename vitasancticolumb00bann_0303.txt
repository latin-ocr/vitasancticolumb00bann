day3 and St. Columba, whose influence was
now confirmed by a ten years’ successful admin-
istration of Hy in addition to his royal de-
scent, occupiedthe same relation tothe Dalriadic
kings that the abbot of Armagh did to the so—
vereigns of Ireland. There was this difference,
however, in the systems, that the Dalriadic
dynasty commenced under Christian auspices.
whereas the sovereiguty of Ireland had des-
cended from Pagan times, and had probably
eonveyed into Christian ages a Pagan mode of
inauguration. The earliest notice we have of
ecclesiastical interfereuce in the confirmation
of royalty in Ireland, is found in the Annals of
Ulster, A. C. 992, where it is recorded that the

meucement of the practice. But see O'Dono-

R. King, Memoir of Primacy, p. 38. Marteue,
treating De solemni Reqmn benedictione, has
the following observation on the present oc-
currence: “Antiquissima omnium, quas inter

Columba abbate Hiensi facta est jussu angeli

antea reges ordinatos fuisse. Sed in Aidani
benedictione illud singulare occurrit, quod non
ab episcopo, sed ab abbate fuerit ordinatus.‘·—

k Cummeneus Albus-Son of Ernan. son of
Fiachna, of the race of Conall Gullutn. He was
seventh abbot of Hy, and presided from 657 to
669. The name is variously written in Irish
Cumine (Tigh. 661), Cumume (id. 669), Cum-
mine (FourMast. 668), Cummem (Mar. Gorrn.;
Cal. Dungall. 24 Fen), Cunune (Mart. Taml.)
To whicli is added the surnaine [mbo (Tigh.
661, 669), or Ριοηη (Mart. Taml. ς Cal. Dun-
gall.; Four Mast.)‚ rendered Albus in the pre-
sent instance, and An⁴ Ult. 663. The writer
uf the Paschal Epistle printed by Ussher (Syll.
xi.) calls himself Cumeanus, and is generally
supposed to have been the samo as Cummineus
Albus, though the identity is very question-
able. The abbot of Hy died in 669, Feb. 24,
which is the day of his commemoration in the
Calendars. Colgan has collected all the facts
and conjectures that are recorded of him, at
Feb. 24. (Act. SS. pp. 408-411.)

¹Lz'bro quem scripsit.—Colgan printh an
anonymous Life of St. Columba, which had been
taken from a manuscript os Miraeus, at Ant-
werp, and was included in Belsortius‘ supple-
ment to Surius. He pronounced it ancient. and
placed it first in order in his collection, but
expressed no opinion of its authorship. (Tr.
Th. pp. 321-324.) Subsequently there appeared
in Mabillon’s Aeta Sanct. Bened. Ord. (vol. i.
pp. 342-349‚ Vonet. 1733) a Life of St. Co-
lumba, differing only, as the Bollandist editor
observes, ‘⁴ in aliquibus loquendi formulis‚''
from that in Colgan. It was printed from a
manuscript of Compeigne <Compendiensis mo-
