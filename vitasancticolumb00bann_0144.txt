sory. This, however, is incorrect, for Colman,
lord of Ossory, his father, died, according to
Tighernach, in 605, which was seven years after
the death of King Aidus. lf the death of Aldus
was the cause of his liberation (which seems to
be implied in the text), then the “aliqua exilii
tempora‘' would denote the period which elapsed
between 598 and 605. It is remarkable that a
similar expulsion and restoration of his father
Colman is related in the Life of St. Cainnech
(chap. 44. p. 27, Ed. Ormonde), and in that of
St. Mochoemog, (ehap. 30, Colgan, Act. SS. p.
594 b·)

Aidus, was slain in 569; upon which Baedan,
and Eochaidh, his ncphew, became joint sove-
reigns of Ireland. Their death, referred to in
this chapter, is thus related by Tighernach:

on the northern boundary of Argyleshire. The
name in the text seems to signify ‘Height of

of the sea-cals.' In 1292 it was called Arden-
murich, andin 1309 Ardnamurchin. The cha—
