in the Calendars of Cashel and Tamlaeht at
the same day, as cited by Colgan: ⁴¹ Erneneus,

question. His obit, which is unaccountably
omitted by the Four Masters, is given by

which are mentioned in the calendars are Rath-

the British churehes considerably in arrear;
partly owing to their unwillingness to abaudon
ancient institutions, and partly to the circum-
