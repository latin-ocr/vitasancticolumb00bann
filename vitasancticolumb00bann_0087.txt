and some additions which were lately made to it, in order to complete the continuity
of the path, were speedily removed, as foreign to the original desig-n. The chureh
derives its name, it is said, stom Adamnan's shrine, which was preserved there. This
shrine might be supposed to enclose St. Adamnan‘s bones, and ‘to bc the case contain-
ing the reliqwz'ae Admnnamg which were brought over to Ireland in 727 for the. renewa]
ofhis Law, and which were taken back to Hy in 730. But, according to a record in
one of the Brussels MSSJ‘, which was copied by Michael O‘Clery, in 1629, from “ an
old black and diffieult manuscript of parchment,” the contents of tho shrine were the
various relies which Adamnan himself had collected. The record opens by saying.
·‘ Illust-rious was this Adamnan. It was by him was gathered the great collection 01'
the relies [mopcpo] of the saints into one shrine, and that was the shrine which
Cilline Droicthech‘, son of Dicolla, brought to Eriu to make peace and friendship
between the Cinel Conaill and Cincl Eoghain.'’ It then proceeds to enumerate the
twenty-six articles which were enclosed in it, consisting of manuscripts of the Gospels,
hynms, and poems3 articles of apparel belonging to the saints of Ireland; and a few
relies of St. Paul and the Virgin Mai-53 the aggregate of which must have fflled a
large box, and been a rather heavy lead to emry about. Oolgan couplcs this shrine
with the chin-eh of sixteen, and observes⁵z “ Est eeclesia multorum reliquiis nobilis ct
veneranda, Dioeccsis Kill-aladen. in regione de Tir Fhiaehraeh, de qua, vide plura in

ait-h, Abbot of Rechra and Durrow, from whom it was carried off from Donnghmojmw
by the Danes. It is very likely that there were two shrines called Adanman's, thc-
older, containing his own remains', which is the one referred to in the Annals, thr<
otherw, containing the miscellaneous objcets mentioned in the catalogue, which was in
after-times eoupled with his name, and preserved in his ehureh os Skreen.
