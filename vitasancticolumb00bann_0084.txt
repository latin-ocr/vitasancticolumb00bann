lx Appendix to Preface.

have solved that difficulty3 and if he had gone further, he might have found the
Bollandist's remarks³ upon the expression. Lastly, as to the Apology, the rea is of
course different from the narrative of the Vita, while the stylus ac sermo are so similar
to the rest, that none sare the architect of a paradox could discern the difference in
the materials. The Life, where there is a slight variation of style, tells its own story,
for it professes to be compilation ; and we might as well deny the genuineness of Bede’s
Ecclesiastical History, because an early chapter is borrowed firorn Gildas, and another
from Constantius, without acknowlcdgment. There is internal evidence in the Life on
the following points to satisfy any but a theorist, that, 1, It was written by an ecole-
siastic, living in Ioua insula (pp. 176, 181), styled nostra (pp. 12, 178), 111 which was
nostrum monaslere‘um (pp. 58, 72, 177); 2, By the superior of the monastery (pp. 16,
26, 223 lz't.); whose immediate predecessor was Falbeus, and he a successor of Seyf-
mus (pp. 16, 26); 3, By one who conversed with those who had heard S. Columba‘s
voice (p. 7 3); who conversed with a person who remembered the night on which S.
Columba died (p. 238); who conversed with the acquaintanccs of St. Columba’s
friends (pp. 50, 85, 237); who conversed with a person who had witnessed the battle
of Dun-Ceithirn in 629 (p. 9 ς) ; who knew an early fiiend ofthe St. Fintan who died in
635 (p. 22); who conversed with tho nephew of his predecessor Virgnous who died
111 623 (p. 225); who was living when the battle of Magh-Rath took place (p. 200) ;
who witnessed tho ravages of the Great Pestilence (p. 18z); who was a personal
friend of King Aldfrid (p. 18 5); who lived when the House of Gabhran was deolining
(p. 201); 4, By one whose name was Adamnan (pp. 16, 95, 225, 238). Here is an
accumulation of evidence which should satisfy any mind, and the more so as it is
for the most part undesigned and incidentah the internal counterpart of the writer‘s
own declaration: “Hujus ergo praemissae narrationis testes, non bini tantum vel
terni, secundum legem, sed centeni et amplius adhuc exstant'' (pp. 17, 182).

Besides these Latin works, Adamnan is said to have written, 1, A szfe of St.
Patriek. This is stated twice in the Tiipartite Liseb. z, Poenas. Tighernach cites
some verses of his, at the year 69 ς , and the Four Masters, at 742. His alleged Fez'lz're, or
‘ Festology,' consisting of seven quatrains and a half, comes also under this head. The
poem on the remission of the Boromean tribute, containing fifty-two stanzas, though
bearing his name, is hardly compatible with his religious character, and evidences the
genius rather than the piety of the writer. 3, Historia ffibervorum ab 01⁴1yw'ne ad sua
tempo-ra, mentioned by VVardss, but otherwise unknown. 4, Epitome metrica triyinta
roluminum Ieyum Hiberniam-um, also mentioned by 5Vard; and, like tho preceding
article, probably some compilation of modern date and no authority.
