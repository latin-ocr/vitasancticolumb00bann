cis esset trucidandus& an non. At vero Lugbeus, a Sancto ⁵interrogatus de
eodem rege, et regno, et populo, ⁶et respondenS, quasi misertus, dicit, Quid
de illo inquiris misero, qui qua hora ab inimicis occidatur, nullo modo ⁷scire
potest? Sanctus tum deinde profatur, Nunquam in manus tradetur inimico-

notices of its kingS. (Tigh. 694, 722; Ann.
Ult. 657, 693. 721, 779, 869.) The surrounding
tract was called Snssch—Cluooe‚ (An. Ult. 871),
and Arecluta, (Colgan, Act. SS. pp. 178a‚ 181 α,
188 a; Ussher, Wks. vi. p. 217.) The Calen-
dar of Cashel is cited by Colgan for ‘¹ SS. Me-
dranus et Tomanns 111 una ecclesia in Britannia
Arcluidensi.''—Jun. 8. (Act. SS. p. 465 α, n.
3¹-) The early date assigned to the Christian
settlement in Alcluid by the Origines Paroch.
Scot. (i. p. 24) is founded on an erroneous
reading of the Ann. Ult. 554: the place meu-
tioned there is Achadlzcinn in Ulster. See Eccl.

ε Amicus-His special favourite was St.
Kentigern, the friend of St. Columba, through
whose agency Christianity became established
in his dominions, See Vit. S. Kentig. 30, 31,
33, 37. (Pinkert. Vit. Ant. pp. 261, 264, 267,
277.) Merddin calls him Rhydderch Hael
rwggfadur ffydd, ⁸ Ridderch Hael, champion of
the Faith.' (Myvyr. Arch. i. p. 135.)

‘¹ Luyheum Mocumz'n.—See i. 24, 28, 4¹ infr.
Lugueus Mocumin, his brother, is mentioned
at ii. 18, 27 infra.

ε Trucidandus.—He waged war against
Gwenddoleu ap Ceidian, whom he overcame
and slew at the battle of Arderydd, circ. 577.
Merddin Wylet‚ commonly called Met-lin (who

yart, ‘twin-brother‚' as he was addressed by
his sisterGwenddydd,-Cyvoesi (Myvyr.Arch.
i. p. 138 3 Vit. S. Kentig. c. 45; Fordun, iii. 31)
took part in the battle against the Strathclyde
king, of whom, from bitter experience‚ he
makes frequent mentionin his Oian α ΡΙιανοΙιεῖ-
lan, vs. 10, 12, 25, (Myvyr. Arch. i. pp. 135,
138;) and in his Afallen heren, 13‚(1b.i p. 151.)
King Aidan, St. Columba’s friend, was also
opposed to Ridderch, in the battle of Arderydd.
One of the “Three Expensive Battles of the
isle of Britain was when Aeddan Vradog [⁵ the
Treaeherous‚’ Hib. braeotmch, in joining with
the Saxous] went to Alclut to the court ot*
Rydderch Hael: he consumed all the meat and
drink in the palace, leaving not as much as
would seed a fly, and he left neither man nor
beast alive, but destroyed all.'‘—(Triad. 46,
52. (Myvyr. Arch. ii. pp. 11, 66.) The message
in the text may have had reference to Aidan's
hostility.
