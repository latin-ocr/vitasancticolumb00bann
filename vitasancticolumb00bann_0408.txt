nan 01· Eigg. The pedigree of the last is not on record, and all that we know concern—
ing him is what may be gathered from short notices in the Irish Caiendass and Annals.
His name, indeed, occurs at its proper day in the Calendar and Offiees of the Breviary
of Abordeen, but there is no allusion to his history, and therefore the writer of his
memoir in the Acta Sanctorum is obliged to draw entirely upon Irish authorities. We
are told this much of him—that, like St, Columba, St. Maehubha, and St. Moluoc,
this saint was a native of hela-nd, and was led to settle, with a company of followers,
in th(- west of Scotland, and that he suffered a violent death at the instance of a mali-
cious woman, and by the hands of a marauding party, possibly of Pit-tsc from tho
ncighbouring coast. We leam that he was some-what junior to St. Columba, whose
friend he waS, and in whose community he desired to be enrolled. He suffered mar-
tyrdom on Sunday, the 17th of April, 617.

His commemoration in the Feilirc of AEngus, and the accompanying commentary,

¹· Picta-The Life of St. Comgall relates that
while he abode in the Reyio Hem, that is, Tiree,
about the year 565, “gentiles latrunculi multi de
Pictonibus irruerunt in villam illam, ut raperent
omnia quae ibi eraut, sive homines, sive pecora-''—
cap. 22 (Fleming, Collectan. p. 307 b). It would
appear from this that the Picts, in their piratica!
character, still hovered about the Western Islands.
See the case of Artbmnun, at p. 62. and the ex-
tracts from Tighernach at p. 290, supra.

bears the name of St. Jerom we find the following
notice: ‘² xv. Kal. Maii. In Antiochia natalis

Argyleshire was formerly called Ecclesia S. Petri

obscure marty-r of the East thus prominently com-
memorated in the far West. See Acta Sanctorum,
April. tom. ii. p. 479.
