Seotiae pervenisset, Sanctus Columba primus episeopus 111 Dunkel puerum suscepit.
unaque cum puellula quadam, nomine Brigida ex Hybernia oriunda, retinuit et ali-
quandiu edueavit¹⁷³. And in the following chapter: “Postmodum vero cum matre
puer ad insulam quae Hy dicitnr, profectus est, ubi aliquandiu cuni religiosis viris loci
illius conversatus est.'’ Now the word Seoffia in these authorities savoms very much
of circ. 1 100, 01· later. A writer of that period would find Dunkeld a bishop’s see, and
the name Columba intimately associated with it. Hence, by a process similar to that
which made St. Eunan bislzop of Raphoe 111 Ireland, he would argue that the founder
of St. Columba's diocesan chin‘eh of Dunkeld was a Columbab and a bishop. But 1110
fact was otherwise. The Dauish descents 011 Hy in the early part of the ninth cen-
tury, and the rise of Kells 111 Ircland, had caused a diversion in the administration of
the Columbian brotherhood; and when, soon after, the Pictish nation yieldcd to 800110
rule, and Kenneth Mac Alpin transferi-ed the seat of government to the eastern side 01“
the kingdom, a collateral movement took place in the ecclesiastical 00011001)- of his do-
minions: and accordingly, circ. 849, he founded a church at the seat of government.
which was to be an inland Hy, and the representative of the Columbian institution for
the United Kingdom. In furtheranee of this project, St. Columkille was named 1111·
patron saint, and a portion of his relies, real or alleged, were deposited in the site, as a
material guarantee of the dedication& Hence 1110 9111 of June became the proper festi*
val of Dunkeld‚ and St. Columba's memory associated with its future history‘1. As the
new foundation was essentially Columbian, the intercourse which previously existed
between the mother ehurch and Ireland was extended to the 01151 01“ scotland: and
for this reason the few names of the early abbots of Dunkeld which arc preserved are
strictly Irish, and found in In'sh Annals only. Hy continued to decline, and Duukeld
