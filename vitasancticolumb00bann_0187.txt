kerton‘s Auteriorum is both unmeaning and
unauthorized. The word is the genitive ot'
Anterivres, which Adamnan employs instead of
the more obvious Orientales. In this he is sup-
ported by two remarkable passages. The first
is a line in the alleged druidical prophecy os St.
Patriek's coming (Petrie's Tarsi, pp. 53. 54):

(1 nuovo i n-cnpeep (1 rigi,

which Muirchu, in the Book ofArmagh, renders

‘¹ A sua mensa. ex anteriore parte domus suae¹²
(sol. 2 b α), and Probus by the same words (Vit.

S. Patr. c. 26, Tr. Th. p. 49 a). ln the scholia
ou Fiech's Hymn, however (Tr. Th. p. 5b),
the second, third, and fourth Lives of St Patrick
in Colgan’s collection (ib. pp. 1411, 23 b, 40 a),
as well as Jocelin, c. 31 (ib. 71 h), aud Colgan's
version of the Tripartite Life (i. 43, ib. 123 b),
the word mpeep is rendered by the more com-
mon expression oriens, or orientalis-playa. The
other passage occurs also in the Book of Ar-
magh, where Muirchu, relating St. Patrick's
course along the coast of Leinster and L‘lster,
notices the little island of Inis Padruic, now
St. Patrick's bland, off Holmpatrick ou the
east coast (Ord. Surv. Co. Dublin, s. 5), in
these words ε-ί Ad anteriorem insolam qua: ejus
nomine usque hodie nominatur prurim navis
convertit’ (fol. 2 b b). In this use of the word,
the writers had reference to the primary notion
entertained by the lrish of the cardinal points,
which supposed the face turned to the East.
(‘contra ortum soliay Lib. Armac. fol. 12 a a),
constituting this point, which is cup ante, the
amem anterior (like the Heb. 07¹3, which from
antrorsum comes to signify oriens), that is the

dextra (Heb. lm* dexter. then meridies) the Del·-

tralis„ or North. But the use of riylzt and left
for south and north is much more frequent in
the Latin of Celtic writers than sore or rear.
Thus (lettera, Lib. Armae. fol. 3aa, 3ba, 6I1a,
18 αα; sinistralis, ib. fol. 2 b b. 7 (ιΙ); Nen-
nius, §§ 12, 42, 62. (Ed. Stev. pp. 10, 34, 52.)
On the use of these two words see Ussher, Brit.
Eccl. Ant. v. xv. (WkS. vol. v. p. 103, vi. pp. i 14.
187); Zenss, Grani. Celt. pp. 67, 283, 566; Pe-
trie's Tara, pp. 41, 423 Irish Nennius, p. 41.
In the present ease Anteriorcs is a radicat equi-
valent for the lrish GmCecmo, a name which
was applied to the eastern section of the Airghi-
alla, or inhabitants of the territory afterwards
called Orio! or Uriel. The Airghialla wei-v
the descendants of Colla Dachrich, and dei-ix ml
their name from in διοῑῑει, ‘golden lmstagvs?
(O'Donovan on Book ol'flights, p. 140.) 'l'hey
were represented in the Middle Agr-s by thi—
Mac Mahons, Maguires, O'Hanlons. and Mac
Canus. When St. Patrick founded th„¹ chin-eh
of Armagh, a descendant ofeolla was king os
the Airtheara. whose territory contained tlu-
greater part ot* the present county of Armagh.
Accordingly, 'siret-han places the church ot
Armagh in reyionimts Orientalium, and reprt¹⁴
sents the orientales as striving to obtain
possession of St. Patrick's remains (Lib. Ar>
macari. fol. 6bb, sba). The Tripartite Lite
also represents Daire as king of the region
called Oirlhir⁷ id ese, Orientalis (iii. 71. Tr.
Th. 162 b). Ronan's father was lord of the
territoryin St. Columba's time. Subsequently
the name Ait-thear underwent liniitation: the
district round Armagh became appropriated
