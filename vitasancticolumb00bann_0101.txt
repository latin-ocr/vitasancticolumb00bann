Summary os St. Columha’s Life. lxxvii

of Movinek, also one of our saint’s preceptor-S, was removed by death in 579. About
the same time a question arose between St. Columba and St. Comgall, concerni-ug a
church in the neighbourhood of Coleraine, which was taken up by their respective
raoes, and engaged them in sanguinary stm'se& In 587 another battle was fought,
namely, at Cuilfedham, near Clonard, in which engagement also St. Columba is said
to have been an interestcd party.

In judging of the martial propensitics of St. Columba, it will always be necessary
to bear in mind the complexion of tho times in which he was born, and the peculim·
condition of society in his day, which required even women to enter battle, and justi-
fied ecelesiasties in the occasional exereise of waffaren. Moreover, if we may judge
from the biographical reeords which have deseended to us, primitive Irish ecclesi-
asties, and especially the superior class, commonly known as saints, were very impa—
tit-nt of contradiction, and very resontful of injur50. Excornmum'cation, tasting
against, and nursing, were in frequent employment, and inanimate, as well as animate
objeets are represented as the subjects of their maledictions. St. Columba, who seems
to have inherited the high bearing of his racc, was not disposed to receive injuries, 01·
even affronts, in silence. Adamnan rclatesv how he. pursued a plunderer with emses,
following the retiring boat into the sea, until the water reached to his knces. We
have an account‘¹ also of his cursing a miser who neglected to extend hospitality to
him. On another occasion‘, in Himba, he excommunicated some plunderch of the
(·l1urcli; and one of them afterwards perished in combat, being transfixed by a spem·
which was disehargcd in St. Columba's name. Possibly some current stories of the
Saint’s imperious and vindietive temper²³ may have suggested to Vener-able Rode the
qualified approbation “ qualiscumque suerit ipse, nos hoe (le illo certum tenemus, quin
reliquit successores magna continentia ac divino amore regularique institutione insig-
nes..'’ With the profound respectu in which liis meinory was held, there seems to have
