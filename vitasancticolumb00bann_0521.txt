quenees of the potato blight have, of late, greatly reduced its amount. The peoplc
are chiefly collected into a little village on the eastern side, and any dwellings which
are (letached are in the arablc portions of the northern half, for thc southern district is
unjnhabited. Previously to the Reformation‚ the island formed a distinct parish, the
church of which, called Tempull-Ronaig, stood within the precinets of the nunnery.
subsequently it was annexed to the great union os Kilfiniehcn and Kilviceuenh, in the
adjacent part of Mun, and so continues, except in its quoad sacra relations.

The local features of the island auuded to by Adamnan are but few, and incident-
ally mentioned; they are as follows: Munitis] Maffna (107) ; AIons qui monasterio
eminus supereminet (58); Montz'celltcs <monasterio supereminens (z3z); Montz'eellzcs qui

Archdeacon Monro speaks of “a monastery of mounckes, and ane uther of nuns,
with a paroche kirke, and sundrie uther chapells.’' The Description, 1693, tells of
“many chapells;” and another old authority says, “ 111 this island are many other
small chapells”³. Dr. Johnson and ΜΓ. Boswell, in 1773, state that St. Oran's ehapel
and four others were then standing, while three more were remembcred. The com-
piler of the Orig. Paroch. conjectures that the four here spoken of may refer to 1110
four small chapels within the choir of the cathedral (vol. ii. p. 300); but it is 1111110-
cessary to have recourse to portions of the principal church.

angles, that in the north 2 feet high, that in the south 3 feet. It is roofless, and the
walls are fast decaying. The great object of interest is the Romanosque circular-
headed west door, decorated with what is called the beak-head ornament. This
