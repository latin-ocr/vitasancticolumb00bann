⁴¹ AEquoreos.——Derry was a point of commu-
nication with Hy, see i. 2, ii. 395 O’Donnell,
iii. 21. In coming to Druimceatt, St. Columba
entered the mouth of Lough Foyle (O'Don. iii.

land onthis occasion, he embarked at Coleraine.

² Comyellus-—Founder and first abbot ofBan-
gor in the Ards of Ulster. born in 517, died in
602. The introductiou of his name here is very
natural, as the church of Cambas, which is men-
tioned a little further on, was founded by him,
and is situate in the next parish to that where
this interview took place, being distant about
four miles east of Dun-Cehern, or the Sconce.
Coneerning his parentage, see the following
note on Crathinipopuli, and that on his name in
iii. 17, infra. On his chief monastery see the
note iii. 13, infra.

s Supra memorata munitione—This refers to
the name in the titulus, the omission of which
by the Bollandists leaves their text iu this
place imperfect. The saruc observation applies
to the text of the shorter recension represented
by Codd. C. D. F. S„ which exhibits the words
supra memorata, but has 110 antecedent mention
of the naine3 proving that there has been an
omission. and that consequently the text in
that family of MSS. is an abridged one. See
noteb‚ p. 66, and note ⁴¹, p. 76, supra.

ἔ Nellis Nepotes.-That is, Ui Heni, com-
monly called HJJ-Nem, or the descendants of
Niall of the Nine Hostages. The sons of this
monarch by his first wife were Laeghaire, St.
Patrick's contemporary, and Conall Crimthann,
grandfather of Dermait Mac Cerbhail, mcn-
tioned above in cap. 36. whose descendants oc-
cupied Meath, and were, from their position,
styled the southern Hy Nem. By his second
wife he had Eoghan, ancestor of the Cenel
Eoghain, who gave name to Tyrone and Inish-
owen, and were in after times represented by
the O'Neill samily3 Conall Gulban, ancestor of
the Cinel Conaill, who gave name to Tir—Con-
nell, now Donegal; Can-bre, Enna, and others of
inferior note, collectively forming the Northern
Hy Neill. St. Columba was great-grandson of
Conall Gulban, and first-cousin of Ainmire,the
