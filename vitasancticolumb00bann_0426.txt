precedjng conjunction, and, dismembering the word, read cu 1015αὸ, cum lecto, thus re-
ferring us to 1110 “nuda petra⁷’ of p. 233, supra. This liberty they took with the
original, not knowing, it would seem, what cubebo& meant. They found the word
again 111 the following passage of 1110 Annals of Ulster, which relates an outrage eom-

The successor of Patriek was openly
outraged 111 his presenee; for his retinue
were plundered, aud some of them were
killed; and a clerieal student of his own

people, whobore a ezclebasz, was slain there.

Thus it appears that the word was a general term. We are brought a step further
towards 1110 meaning of it by a passage 111 the Prefaee to the Amhra Coluim-cffle ε
