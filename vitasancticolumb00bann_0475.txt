rowed to the adjacent lands of Mun or a few of the Western Islands1. F inally, when
the Bishops of the Isles⁸ made Hy their episcopal seat, the monastic character of the
institution merged in diocesan authority. The privileges of Armanaeh and Frayraman-
ach, so called from (lp monach, Aratio monachorum, and s-”peofflio monach, Respow
εἰσ monachorum, which existed at Hyb in the fourteenth century, were probably the
vestiges of ancient rights of the monastery to duty-work from the tenants of its lands,
or the neighbours of its churches, which titularly had passed to the Lords of the Islesy
in consideration of a stated endowment as a commutation for an undefined exaetion.

Tm: materials from which the following chronicle is eompiled are furnished prin-
cipally by the Irish AnnaJS, especially those of Ulster, and they are here disposed in
such a manner as to exhibit, under each abbot, the principa] Scottish events of his in-
cumbeney. Down to the year 800, the succession of abbots is unbroken, and the
notiees of them, though meagre, are generally satisfactory; but, after that date, the
entries become irregular‚ and progressively defective. This is partly attributable to
the derangement of the Columbian economy caused by the Danish invasions, and the
consequent transfer of the scat of administration to Ireland. The office of abbot, in-
deed, was still maintained in Hy, but as it became subordinate to that of C'oarb or Sue-
cessor of Columeille, whose dignity was, to a certain extent, ambulatory among the
Columbian houses of Ireland, the notices are desultory, and the consideration ofthv
local superior gradually declined, till it almost vanished from the attention of tho
annalist. Another marked difference between the two periods is the constant registration
of obituary days in the former, and its almost total discontinuance in the latter. With
two exceptions, the festivals of the first eighteen abbots are entered in the calendars of
Marian Gorman and of Donegall; but after the year 800 there are only four commemor-
ations connected with Hy on record, during the lapse of four hundred years.
