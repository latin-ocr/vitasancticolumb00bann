ὃ Domnallusfilius Aido.—Ainmire. his grand-
father, was St. Columba's first· cousin. Con-
eerning his father, see next chapter. Aido,
properly Clebo, is the old genitive of Gen, like
Feryuso in Praef. ii. (p. 8 supra), and i. 43. 49.

49, ii. 6. Aldus, father of Domnall, was sove-
reign of Ireland when the famous convention
was held here. Colgan and O'Flaherty, fol-
lowed by Chalmers and others, have assigned
590 as its date. The Annals of Clonmacnoise
notice it at 587 ς but the Annals of Ulster place
it at 574: Magna τηοῃῡωῑ ,1. com-enlin Drama-
elzeta, in qua erant celuim-cille ocurmuc cun-
mmessch [et filius Ainmirei} This date is
confirmed by a poem cited in the preface to the
Amhrai-Ms. Trin. Coll. Dub. H. z. 16 (p. 680).
Fordun blunderingly calls the place “Insula
Dorcete.” (Scotichr. iii. 41.) Thc precise spot
where the assembly was held is the long mound
iu Roe Park, near Newtownlimavaddy, called
the Mullayh‚ and sometimes Duisy Hill. (Ord.
Survey, Londonderry, s. 9.) The memory of
the event has totally perished in the neigh-
bourhood, but in 1645 it was vividly pre-
served, for Colgau‚ writing at that date, says:

Act. SS. p. 204 b, n, 13· The convention was
held in this neighbourhood, partly sor the con-
venience of King Avdan, but more especially
because this was the patrimonia! territory of
the Irish monarch. See note ²¹. p, 3² supra.

0 Superstes erit.-Conall Cu, his eldest bro-
ther, suruarned Cloqaclz or ⁸ Delirious,’ who op-
posed St. Columb at Druimceatt, was defeated
by Colman Rimidh at the battle of Sleamhain
[Slewin], near Mullingar‚ in 602, and died in
⁶04· Cumuseach, his second brothor, was
slain by Brandubh at Dun Bucat [Dunboyke]v
in Wicklow, in 597. Mac-lcobha, the third,
suceeeded to the throne in 61 2, and, atter three
years' enjoyment ofit‚ was slain at the battle ot
Belgadin or Sliabh-Truim [now Bessy Bell] in
Tyrone⁷ by Suibhne Meann, who held the sove-
reignty till 628, when he was slain. and Domh·
nall, mentioned in the text, became monarch of
Ireland.

Ceithern in 629 (see chap. 49 infra). and the
more important one of Magh Rath in 637. See
