guage3 for the reference cannot be to the
Latin language‚ because in such case the
toacher could be his own interpreter. Ven.
Beda, also, recognises the distinction, for lie
states the five written languages of Great Bri-
tain to be ‘⁴ Anglorum, Brittonum, Scottorum,
Pictorum. et Latinorum⁷' (H. E. i. 1); and the
four spoken tongues to be “Brittonum‚ Picto-
rum, Scottorum, et Angloruns' (Ibid. iii. 6).
The Pictish was undoubtedly a Celtic dialect,
but more nearly allied to the British or Welsh
than the Gaelic. Of this the eastern topogra—
phy of Scotland is satisfactory evidence: to
which may be added the four recorded Pictish
words Carcoit (ι. ῦθοὶδ ,1. beciplo Cnuffineoc,
⁴ a pin, in the Pictish tongue’—Cormac‚ Gloss.
in voc.); Pean-saltel (Bede, H. E. i. 12).·, and

nominantur‚’'—Reginald. Dunelm. de Cuthberti
