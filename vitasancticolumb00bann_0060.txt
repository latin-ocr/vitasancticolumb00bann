xxxvi Preface.

copious abstractz of this compilation in Latin, preserving the principal parti-
culars of the narrative, but omitting the outrageously sabulous portionsa, as
well as those which were not in accordance with his ecclesiastical feelingsb3
and divided the whole into three books, agreeing with the three chief eras of
the Saint’s life :—-1. From his birth to the battle of Cooldrevny. 2. From
that event, as the cause of his departure from Ireland, to his temporary return
to attend the convention of Drumceatt. 3. From the convention of Drum-
ceatt to his death. This compilation is important as a depository of all the
existing traditions concerning St. Columba, but it throws uo real light- on
Adamnan, either in solving a difficulty, or identifying a place⁰; and its great
1110111111)γ only serves to show how much superior Adamnan’s memoir is to any
other record professing to be an account of the Saint’s life: and, after all, how
little historical matter has been added to that work by the utmost endeavours
of those best qualified to succeed in the attempt. To Adamnan is, indeed,
owing the historic precision‚ and the intelligible operation, which characterize
the second stage of the ancient Irish Church. In the absence of his memoir,
the Life of St. Columba would degenerate into the foggy, unrcal‚ species of
narrative which belongs to the Lives of his contemporaries, a'nd we should
be entirely in the dark on many points os discipline and belief, concerning
which we have now a considerable amount of satisfactory information.

Adamnan’s memoir is, therefore, to be prized as an inestimable literary
relic of the Irish Church: perhaps, with all its defects, the most valuable
monument of that institution which has escaped the ravages of time. The
editor, at least, felt it to be so: and has therefore taken great pains, in the
niidst of many difficulties and discouragementS, to call into his service all the
means of illustration which books, places, and men could afford.

What has been done to restore the text to its purity has already been
stated. It may be added that the Glossary, which belongs to this depart-
ment of the work, exhibite many vocables not notieed by Du Gange or his
editors; and assigns some new significations to words already known.

Through the valuable aid of Professors Curry and O’Donovan‚ the editor
possessed himself of all the materials which were to 110 found in Irish manu-
