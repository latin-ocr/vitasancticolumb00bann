200 Vita Sancti Columbae

[Lm. 111.

niam nullus adversariorum tuorum tibi poterit resistere, donee prius 2‘’fraudu-
lentiam agas in me et in posteros meos. Propterea ergo tu filiis commenda
ut et ipsi filiis et nepotibus et posteris suis commendent, ne per consilia mala
eorum sceptrum regni hujus de manibus suis perdant. In quocunque enim
tempore ”adversum me aut adversus cognatos meos qui sunt in Hibernia
fecerint, flagellum, quod causa tui ab angelo sustinui per manum Dei super
eos in magnum flagitium vertetur, et cor virorum auferetur ab eis et inimici

eorum vehementer super eos confortabunturm.

nasterii), and was intituled Auctore cummeneo
Albo. Thus 3 work which was supposed by
some to have been lost was brought to light
from two independent sources. It forms the
groundwork of Adamnan‘s third book, into
which he has transferred the whole tract, with
the exception of two ehapters which he has
worked into an earlier part, observing the
order of the narrative, and in many instances
employing the very expressions of his prede-
cessor. The Bollandist editor was of opinion
that the scribe who wrote the Compeigne MS.
“ recentiorem Latinaeque linguae studiosorem
fuisse” than the writer of the Bclfort exemplar,
and for that reason gave a preference to the
latter as a text for the l'z’la Brevior at St. Co-
lumba‘s day. (Act. SS. Jun. tom. ii. p. 185 b.)
On comparison, however, it will be found that
Mabillon's text agrees better with Adamnan's
than that of Colgan. The Irish Franciscaus,
who saved the hagiology of their country, sup-
posed that the Life, or rather portions of two
Lives, which are preserved in the Codex Sal-
manticensis, and are printed No. 2 in Colgan’s
collection, were the genuine production of
Cummineus. Accordingly O'Clery, in the Ca-
lendar of Donegal, under Cummz'an Fionn, at
Feb. 24, observes: Do rffluob bseu Coluun-
ciue ι 34 oo omboitib, ompob cup Ven. Abbas

Life of Columkille in 34 chapters, which com-

mences thus: Venerabilis Ablms. &e-r This
description led Colgan to express it as his opiu-
ion that the second Life in his collection was
by Cummiueus; and though he was unable to
find in it the passage cited by Adamnan, he
supposed that its absence was caused by a
chasm in the manuscript. Pinkerton reprints
Mabillon‘s text. (vit. Antiqss pp. 27-45.>

¹²² Confitrtabuntur.—The following are Cum-
miueus' words as found in Mabillon's text, to
which are added in brackets the variations in
Colgan: ‘⁴ Indubitanter crede o Aidane, quo-
niam [quod] nullus adversariorum tuorum [om.
Colg.] tibi poterit resistere donec prius srau-
dem agas in me et in posteros meos. His eisdem
[ipsis] verbis alloquere filios tuos, ne regnum
perdant. Quod si nou obaudierint flagellum
quod causa tui ab Angelo Dei [vm. Colg.] sus-
tinui, in eos retorquebitur.'' (Act. SS. Bene-
dict. Ord. i. p. 343; Colg. Tr. Th. p. 32¹ b;
Act. SS. Jun. ii. p. 186 α.)
