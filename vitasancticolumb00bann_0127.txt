that Oissene, one of his race, would, in all
likelihood, be familiar with S. Fintan's history.

Ant. c. 17. (worm, vi. p. 503.)

³ Mediterranea—The Umbilicus Hiberum,
which has been variously placed at Ushnagh
Hill, Clonmacnoise‚ and Birr, belonged to the
south-west of the great plain of Meath. See
note on iii. 9 insta.

mo5h, or Oecm mogh. Adamnau employs the
Latin equivalent Roboreli Campus at i. 29, 49,
ii. 39, iii. 15; and Roboris Campus at ii. 2.
Speaking of Columba, Bede says: “Fecerat
autem, priusquam Brittaniam veniret, monaste-
rium nobile in Hibernia, quod a copia. roborum
Dearmach lingua Scottorum. hoc est, Campus
roborum= cognominatur.”—-(H. E. iii. 4.) The
modern name is Durrow, and belongs to a
parish of the diocese of Meath, situate in the
barony of Ballycowan, on the north of King's
County, and extending a. short way into west-
meath. It anciently formed part of the terri-
tory Fer-Ceam, which was included in the* king-
dom of Teathbha [Teffia]. On the death of
Crimthann, in 533, the lordship descended to
his nephew Aedh, whose father, Brendan, sur-
vived till 576, but does not appear to have en-

Bede's statement be correct, that Durrow wa>

narrative, while it describes S. Columba as
“fundans‚'' couples the date of the occurrence
with the presidency of Alithir at Clonmaenoise,
who did not succeed to that office till June.

this expression in the sense of confirminy. or
suppose an inaccuracy in Bede. If it could be

which was thirteen years subsequent to S. Co-
lumba's departure. A similar conclusion would
follow srom the identification of the visit men—

recorded iu the Life of S. Ciaran: *Α Post lou-
