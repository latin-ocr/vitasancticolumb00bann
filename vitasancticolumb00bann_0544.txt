or by Convauanus‚ according to Boece¹; or by the ncver-failing Druidsm, according to
the natives, every statement that is written is perfect fiction, or, rather, imperfect fic-
tion, for it is nonsense. Columba probably found Hy unoccupied and unelaimed, Conall
lcindly promised not to dist-urb him, and when the Picts were conver-ted, Brudeus, the
supreme lord, of course gave to the infant institution all the right and title which the
weight of his sanct-ion could confer.

Conall was succccded by his cousin Aedhan, -the Aidanus of Adamuan. This
prince was the first of the Dalriadian rulers who evinced any great ability; he ex-
changed the rank of a coupech, or lord, for that of a 1115, or king, and under him it
was that the real foundation of the Scottish monarchy was laid. Hc procured for him-
self 3 solemn inaugmtion, and when the monarch of Ireland, who hitherto looked upon
the Dalriads as a tributary colony, required his submission, he boldly refused to act as
3 subordinate, and at the convent-ion of Drumceatt obtained a formal recognition of
his independence (92). The coincidence of the date of this convenfion in the Ann. Ut.
nith the first year of Aedhan’s reign is a very significant fact. He was closely con-
nected with the Strathclydc Britohs, and his wife¹² seems to have been one of that people.
Wclsh writers call him Acddan, son, by Lleian, daughter of Brychon, of Gafran ap
Dysnwal Heu, giving him the epithet Vradog, or false (44). According to AEngus
tho Culdce, Mathgemm, wife of Caireall, and mother of St. Molaissi of Leighlin and
Lamlash, was his daughter, who was styled, from the regal seat of the. Dalriads,

¹ Bacca—He represents the Scotto exiles under
Maximus as taking refuge in Iona¹ and founding a
monastery there. See Usstoer, Ind. Chr. 379.

¹⁰ Dmids.—The writer in the Old Stat. Acct. is
very decided: “The Druids undoubtedly possessed
Ι, before the introduction of Christianity” (xiv. p.
199). To the Highlauders of the present day Iona
is known as Inzm's-nan-Dmidhneach, or ‘Island of
the Druids' (New Stat. Acct. vol. vii. pt. 2, p. 313).
“ It is said that the Druids had possession of Iona

before the birth of our Saviour, and that they had
there a college or school of theology, and continued
to flourish until their expulsion by Columbae* (ib.
p. 320). This is believed as firmly by the natives
as that St. Columcille existed, and is 3 standing dish
sor the tom-ists.

¹³ Wfi.—-The Life οἰ St. Lasreanus or Molaisi,
speaking of his birth, says: “mater ejus virtutum
meritis et nomine Gemma, Aedani regis Scotiae filia,
regisque Britanniae neptis ruie' (Act. SS. April. tom.
ii. p. 454 b).
