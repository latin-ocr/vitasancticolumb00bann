The other Lives of St. Columba are the following :—

I. That by Cummene, already mentioned, and of which an account is
given at p. 199 of this work.

ΙΙ. The first part of Colgan's V ita secundat, which he found in the Sa—
lamanca MS.==‚ and erroneously supposed to be by Cumineus. It is a succinet
aud chronological digest of the principal recorded events of the Saint’s life, and
supplies from the old Irish Life some particulare not recorded by Adamnan.

ΙΙΙ. A Life by ‚John of Tinmoutlff, pirated by Capgrave& and reprinted
by Colgan with notes, in the Trias, where it appears as the Vita Tertiaz. It
is principally compiled from Adamnan‚ and ends with the monition¹¹z ‘⁶ Est
autem sciendum quod Hibernia proprie Scotorum est patria: antiquitus igitur
Scotia pro Hibernia saepius scribi solet sicut hic in vita saneti Columbe diligenter
intuentibus apparet. Et etiam venerabilis Beda de gestis Anglorum multis
in loeis Hiberniam exprimere volem, Scotiam scripsit.”

IV. The office in the Breviary of Aberdeenb, containing nine short les-
sons, borrowed, in an abridged form, from Adamnan.

V. An abridgment of Adamnan, printed by Beneilict Gononc under the
title Vita S. Columboe, sive Columbani‚ Presbyteri et Confessoris (qui alius est
ὰ S. Columbano Luxoviefzsi abbate) ex illa prolium quam scripsit Adamannus
abbas Insulae Huensz's in scotia. It occupies three folio pages, double columns,
and is accompanied by three trifling notulae.

VI. An ancient Irish memoir, frequently referred to in the following
pages as che old Irlslz Life. It is a composition probably as old as the tenth
centia-y, and was originally compiled‚ to be read as a discourse on St. Co-
lumba’s festival& on the text Exi de terra tua et de coquatioue tua, et de domo
