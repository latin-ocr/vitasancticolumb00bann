IlIemoir of St. Adanman. li

St. Patriek’s memoirs in the Book of Armagh. It is a remarkable fact, however, that,
with the exception of tho Abbot of Armagh, and Cenufaeladh', Abbot of Bangor, the
rest of the clergy were from Leinster and the south. At the head of the laity was
Loingsech, son of Aengusss, monareh of heiand, and after him sowy-seron chiefs of
various territorias. Last on the list of temporals is “ Bruide mac Derilih, king of the
region of the Picts.” The enaetments ofthe synod were afterwards called Lernislmnnaniff,
or Cain Adkamknaz‘nk, which means “ tribute of Adamnan,'’ because among its results
was the privilege which was concedetl to him and his suceessors of levying pecuniam-
oonm'butions under certain conditions. In aster times, when this assessment became
of sufficient importatum, there was an officer, οι· agent, for its reecipt, styled the
moon canu Οὸωὴηοιη, ‘ Stcwarcl of Adamnan's Law'1.

It was possibly on the same occasion that the question of Easter was publicly dis-
cussed, and the usage advoc-ned by Adamnan adopted. At this time also may hai-v
been promulgatcd those eight canons¹²¹ which bear the nzune of Adamnan, Eeelcsiustical
eonsiderafions, however, if entertained at this meefing, were not of sufficient importunee
in the eyes of the Irish to merit :ui entry in a joumal; and the absorbing subject seems
to have been the civil enactmont which afterwards became a somne of proiit, and for
this reason had special claims upon the memory.

In the mystified style of ‘the Irish, it is sometimes dangerous, and always diffi-
cult, to deal with their statements as historica] records; but thoro seems to bc ground

original, which the editor has examined. Colgan
understauds it of “Eebertus Anglus.'' See p, 179,

‘lVickloxw near the town of the same nume.

⁸ Murchu mac UMacteni.-The entry of this
name in the acts of Adamnan's synod is of im-
portauce in the history of the Book of Armagh, as
it serres to fixthe date of Mnirchu Maccumuchtheni,
whose name is attached to a portion of the Memoirs
of St. Patrick in that volume, iu these words:
“Haec pauca de sancti Pau-lcii peritia et virtutibus
Muirchu Maccumacntheni, dictante Aiduo Slebti-
msis civitatis episcopo, couscripsw (fol. 20, ba).
The name of his informant also occurs in the acts
of the synod, in the form Aedh epscop Sleibte,
whose day is Feb. 7, and whose obit is entered in
'rig-hernach at 700, and in the Annals of Ulster at
699. Murchu mac Ua Maiefflene, and his brother
Meadhran, are noticed in the Irish Calenzlars at
June 83 and the Calendar of Cashel, cited by Col-
gan (Act. SS. p. 465 a, n. 31), places their com-
memoration at Kill-Murchom in the territory of

s Cennsaeladh.—His obit is in the Anu. Ur. at
704, and his day in the Calendar at Apr. 8.

ς Lviuysech, son of .·1e119us.—He succeeded Fiu-
naehta in 695, and reigned till 703.

h avide mac Dant-Cauni bomne mac Oe-
rulx m epumen cumize. He died iu 706, in the
eleventh year of his reign. The introduction os his
name into the acts is suspicions, unless we suppose
him to have attended at this synod as Aidan, son of
Gabhran, did at Drumceatt.

brought to light.
