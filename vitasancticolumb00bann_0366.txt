time before, adopts the book-name rona, or Iona. Stin, however, the old forms
Icobltckoe'll, Yoolmkill, and Eeolmkill, were almost universally employed in legal docu—
ments⁹; while in vernacular use Ee-olwluim-cln'lle has, from time immemoriaL been
the only recognised name of 1110 island among the Graelio population-

Α parish in Lewis, 111 the modern union of Stomowayq, is called Ey or Y.

The conclusion, therefore, to be come to regarding Iona is, that it is a word which
was suggested by an error in writing, and was confirmed by a supposed connexion with
unc of St. Columba’s names; while the genuine form Ioua is 1ο be regarded as an ad-
jective with a feminine te1·n1inati0n‚—the root of which is Iow, like Eo of Tighernach
and Walafridus, which was sounded 111 one syllable something like the English yseo.
Thus Conall Macgeoghegan, in his old English version of the Annals of Clonmacnoise,

wn’tes ‘the name Huqlc (569, 590, &c.).

To the viv-id description of 1110 Coire-Brccain, which is given in Corniac's Glossmy’,
may be added the following translation from the comment 011 1110 name in the ancient
topographical work, the Dinnseanehusb:—

“ (sosre Brecm'n, why 80 called—A great boiling cauldron which is 51111010 between
Erin :md Alba, 011 the north : it 15 the confluonce of many 50115, from 1110 west, from
1110 eust. from tho south, and from the north3 each poming itself into the place of the
other, until they are swallowed down to 1110 bottom, and until 11 15 like an open caul-
‹li-011²v sueking in and disgorging its d1·aughts; so ‘chat 115 roaring is like to distant
thunder. And it was 11110 11115 that Brccan, the son of Partholzmd, was drawn, and
was drowned, with his fifty boats, when he fled out of Erin from his father.”
