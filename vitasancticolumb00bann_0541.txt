Wrrnonr entering into the. question of previous eolonizationss, it is generally agreed
that about the year 506 a portion of the family of Eiro, son of Muinreamhar, past pos-
sessore of Dahiada, now known as the northern half of the eounty of Antrim, and the
senior representatives of Cairbrc Righfada (92), called Reuda by Bedeb, and Riada0 by
later writers, passed over with a considerable body of followers to the nearest part of
Argyleshire, where they permanently settled, and founded the kingdom of Bn'tish
Scotia or Dalriada. The statement in Tighornachd is, Fearqzcs Mor mac Euo-ca cnm
yeme Dal-Binda partem Britannice tenuit, et ibi mortuus est. This Fergus is said in the,
Tripartite Lifee of St. Patrick to have been the youngest son, and in the most ancient
records of the tribe does not appear as king until the death of his elder brother Loarn.
The subsequent importance ofhis family, however, made him the most remarkable
member of the colony, and hc is put forward as the leader, because the sovereignty,
when once attained, existed in his family for nearly two hundred yearS. According to
the Irish Tract 011 the Men of Alba, “ Three times fifty men were the emigrants that
went forth with the sons of Ere.’' The commencement was comparativcly weak, and
tho territory occupied of very limited extent. From the fact, ‘that after Loarn’s death

s Biatia-It is very remarkable that Dalriada is

branches of the Celtic family by its resistauce to
phonetic spelling; and in this case it is difficule to
account for the exception, unless by supposing that
the compouud was created outside Irelaud, and then
adopted as prononnced.
