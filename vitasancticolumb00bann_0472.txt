monastery, where they enjoyed undisturbed meditation‘, without breaking

in Adamnan’s time, was Finan the reeluse of Diu-row (95), and Fergna of
Muirbulcmart in Himba (237). At Hy an anchorite held the abbaey in 747 (F. Mast.)‚
:in anchorite was abbot elect in 935 (F. M.)‚ and another, bishop in 964 (F. M.) The
abode of such was called a Dipone, from the Latin desertum ,· and as the heremitical
lifeu was held in such honour among the Seotie ehurehes, we frequently find the word
Desert an element in religious nomenelature. There was a Dz’sert beside the monastery
of Dori-y (Ult. 1122) 3 and that belonging to Hy was situate near the shore 'm the low
ground north of the Cathedral, as may be inferres} from Port-an-Diseart, the name of
:i little buy in this situation. The individual who presided here was styled the
Direpccio, or cenn on Ὀηηῃῦ, ‘ Superior of the Ho1mitage‚’ and the name of one such
‹ifficer at Hy is on record (Ult. 1 164). In 1101, the Four Masters record the endow-
ment of a similar institution at Cashvl for cpoil'meeh or derotees We leam from the
wharters of the Columbian house of Kells that a Dz‘sert existed there, which, about
1084, was endowed with two townlainds and their mills at Leyney, in the county of
Sligo. It was founded expressly sor eppoio neopum, ‘ wandering pilgrims''3 and the
mnditions were: Ro eopoippec ‘oiou im hul] Γιη Ὁηηυῃῦ Clioluun chiLLe hi Csn-

¹ M:irbulcmar.-Virgnous is said (z 37) to have
spent the remain'der ofhis lifi in Hinba ; the first
part os this term he passed in couventual subjec-
tion, the last twelve in seclusion at Muirbuicmar:
therefore Muirbulcmar was in Hinba. But Murbolc

seems to have belonged to a buy. Putting these
hints together, the mind is at once led to the beehive

⁶ exile‚‘ · outlaw,' ‘pilgrim' In the form Deonuisse
it is used in the In‘sh version of Gen. iv. 12, 14, to
express vaqabond. The Welsh dieithr-dhyn seems
cognate to it. The kings of Ireland oecasioually
employed mercenaries called Oeoncn‘o (Bat. of
Magh Rath, p. 163). In Scotland, as well as Ire-
land, the word assumed a religious limitatum, and
from an official became a family name, now known
as Dewar. In 1428, we find the “lator ipsius
