Aedh Slaine, and lord of (1100001111).τ 111 Meath, slew his own cousin Mau, son of
Ceam-nach Sotal. This aot is said to have exeited the indignation of Adamnan, under
whose protection Niau had been, and he denounoed against Irgalaoh speedy retribu-
tion for the crime. At this ‘sime Adamnan is represented to have been in the neigh-
bourhood of the BoyneW, and an ancient poemx states that the cursing of Irgalaeh took
place in a synod held by Adamnan at Tam. Irgalaeh, according to Tighernaeh‚ was
siaiu by the Britons in 7023 and the Annals of Ulster add that the deed was done in
Inis-mae-Nesan, the small island east of Howth, now known as Ireland’s Eye. The
wife of Irgaiaehy was Mummii, daughter of Cellaoh Cualann, and sister of St. Kenti-
gema¹ of Loeh Lomond. She (11οᾶ in 748.

The Life of St. Geraldus⁵ represents Adamnan's connexion with Mayo in these
words ε “ Τ11110 sancius abbas Adamnanus post visitationem tot-ius Hiberniae ad S. Ge-
raldum perrexit, ut fraternam cum eo contraheret societatem. Cui S. Geraldus fundum
cum fonte limpido eontulit, atque sibi suam comendavit Ecclesiam, ut a perseeutione
laicorum post obitum suum eam defenderet: quod totum S. Adamnanus se comple-

* Lortl of monacha—So he is styled in the
Cain Adhumnain, although he could not have 110011
iord by desceut, as the Cianachta were of a different
raee from his. The Annals of Inissallen call him
“ king of Hy Neill‚” which is probably correct, as
his son eionaedh was monarch of Ireland from 724
to 728. Dr. Petrie states that 'righeruach calls
Iorgalach ‘⁸ king of Bregia” (Tara, p. 14S): but
this must be a mistake, or else the prime-l text 11115
omitted the title. It is also an error to say [hat lte
was killed by the Saxam. In 682 the Britons
fought with the Dalaradians at Rathmm, and in
697 they joined the Ulidiaus in wasting the coast of
Louth (pp. 377⁷ 378, infra). Possibly they had
made a settlement iu Ireland.

*¹ Roma-The Irish Life of Adamuan represents
xhe saint as “fasting against Irgalach‚” immersed
in the river Boion, and overnoming him by deceit.
This system offastiny against an obnoxious indivi-
dual was a favoni-ite mode with the Irish ecclesias-
tics of bringing down visitations on their 011οῐ11105-
The Brehon Laws contain directions on the coin-se
which is to be pursued in such a case. Irgalach re-
sisted the influence of St. Adamnan's fasting by
doing the sume himself, until Adamnan, by induc-
ing one of his people to personate him, put Irgalach

off his guard, and thus got the mastery of him.
The story is carious, not only as illustrati-ce of this
extraordinmy system of fasting, but as indicating
the low tone of moral feeling in the writer who re-
presents the saint as saying: ‘⁴ It 15 better that one
of his people should tell a falsehood for him, than
that he should tell it himselff'
