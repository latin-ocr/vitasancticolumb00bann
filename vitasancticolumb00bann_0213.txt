To this wild, but very ancient, legend may be
added another early notice of the stream:
“Primo vero venit [S. Patricius] ad vallem
Sescnani et aedificavit ibi aecclesiam primam
et portavit filium Sesceneum nomine episcopum
secum et reliquit ibi .ii. pueros perigrinos,
Vespere vero venit ad hostium Ailbine ad
quendam virum bonum et babtitzavit illum,
et invenit cum illo filium placitum sibi et dedit
illi nomen Benignum.‘' Tirechan. (Lib. Arma-
can. fol. 9 b a.) This hostium Ailbine was the

the ancient name of Dublin, and that by which
it is still known among the lrish-speaking na-
tives. TheDinnseanchus says that¹ it was called
the Ford of Hurdles from the bundles oftwigs
which the LageiiianS, in the reign os their King
Mesgeira, placed across the river Liffey for the
purpose ot' conveying the sheep ofAthirny Ail-
geasaeh to Dun Edair. See the interesting
paper by J. O'Donovan in Dubl. Pen. Journal⁷
vol. i. p. ¹74· The name, however, was not
peculim· to Dubhn, sor thore was an sse cline
mentumisse, now Clarin Bridge, in Galway3
an Ge chor: un Chopfflnn, now Ballymote, in
Sligo. The etymology of the name Dublin is
thus given in the ancient Lise of St. Coemhgen:
“Civitas Atheliatb, quae est in aquilonali La-
ginensium plaga, super fretum maris posita:
et illud Scotice dicitur Dublin‚ quod sonat La-
tine Nigra Therma.’' (Act. SS. Jun. i. p. 3¹9 a;
Colg. Tr. Th. p. 11211, n. 69, 71; Act. SS. p.
147 b, c.16; Calend. Dungall. Feb. η.) Clme,
‘ a hut-dle,v is allied to the old Welsh cluit, thie
Latin clitellae, and more remotely, to crates
(Anglice crate) aud its diminutive craticula;
closely to the Greek κλῆθρα, and its cognate
clathri; and is directly represented by the later
forms, cleda, cleia, cleta, elaea, cloia, which are
to be found in Ducange, in the sense os wicker
or basket work, and have passed into French
in the form claie. See Zeuss, Gram. Celt. i.
