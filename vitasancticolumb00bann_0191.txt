Churches of the Occfflent, either in those ages
or ours. For by this relation it appears that
in Ycolmkill a priest, even the abbot S. Co-
lumba himself, looked upon a bishop so far su-
perior to him, that he would not presume, even
though iuvited, to concelebrate or celebrate
the holy mysteries jointly with liim.” (Civil
and Ecol. Hist. p. 175.)

² Avunculum—“Ernaan sancti avunculus Co-
lumbar? is mentioned in the Epilogus of eod. B.
as one of the twelve followers of the saint.
Being brother of Ethnea, St.C01umba's 1110-
ther‚ he was son of Dima⁷ son of Noe, anzl a
descendant of Cathaeir Mor. On account of
his grandsatlier's name, Colgan identifies him¹
among twenty-sixErnans in the calendar, with
St. Erniu or Mernoc of Rath-Noe in Hy Garr-
chon, whose day is Aug. 183 bntin this he errs.
See note ¹, p. 25 supra. On the other haud,
this cannot be the Μαι-1100 of the Scotch ea-
]endar at the 25th of October, nor St. Mai-nan
ul'the znd of March, sor both ol' these are styled
bishops‚ while the individual in the text is
stated to be a presbyter. It is to be observed
that Ernan, Ernz'n, fflernoc, and Ferreolus are
different forms of the same name, and iuter-
changeable. See the note on Ferreolus or Er-
nene, iii. 23, § 4‚ins1·tz. St. Columba had a
nephew, also called Mei-noc or Ernan, who
was son orbis sister Cuman. AEngus, de Matr.

§4 Hinbimz insula, i. znsupra. It has not
yet been identified, and unfortunater the clues
afforded by the wriler are very slight. How-
ever, from iii. 5 and 18, it may reasonably be
conjectured to have been north of, and not far
distant from, Hy. The island Canna. which
bears some resemblance in name, lies about
sour miles north-west of Rum. Its cliui-ch. of
which the ruins and a small cross existed in
1772, was named l'rnrn St. Columba. The par—
sonage osthe island belonged to the abbot of
Hy, and the vicarage to the bidmp. (Mar-
