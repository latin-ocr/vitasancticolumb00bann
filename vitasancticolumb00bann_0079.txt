Memmi· of St. Adamnmz. lv

nanus Mageonensem Ecclesiam, per septem annos indefesse rexit. Inde ad lonensem
Abbatiam perrexit, et ibi feliciter in Domino obiit et sepultus cst.’⁷ N ow, though this
statement is open, in the first place, to the grave objection that St. Goraldus was later
than Adamnan instead of prior to him, and, in the second, that a monastery founded
twenty years previously as an asylum for adherents to the old Easter, was not a likely
place to entertain the professed advocate of innovatiom stin, the story seems to be
wrought upon an ancient tradition that St. Adamnan traversed Irelnnd on ecclesiastic-al
duty, and spent some years thomiri, and that, having gone back to Hy at the end ot'
about seven years, he died soon after.

The nanntive of Adamnan's proccedingS‚ from his first visit to the court of Aldffid
down to his last stay in Ireland, 115 given in Mac Firbis's MS. Annals, is so 3111051081)-
characteristic of native simplic-ny, that it. is entitled, notwithstanding its 1005611655,
to find 11 place among more explicit records. “An. 896 [reete 796] In this year
the 111611 of Erin consented to receive jurisdiction and one 11116 from Adamnan respect-
ing the eelebration of Easter 011 Sunday, on the fourteenth of the moon of April3 and
the coronal tonsure of Peter was performed upon the elerics of Erin, forthere had been
great variance in Erin 011 111656 questions, until 111611, inasmuch as some of the elerics
of Erin were in the habit of celebrating Easter 011 Sunday the 14th of the moon of
April, and had the coronal tonsure of Peter the Apostlc, following in the steps of
Patrick⁰; others, following columcille, celebrated Enster on the fourtcenth of the
moon of April, whatever day of the weekvl that fourteenth should happen to fall, and
had the coronal tonsure of Simon Magus2. A third party followed neither the sect ot*
Patrick nor the sect of Columeille, 50 that thc elergy of Erin held many synods, and
they used to come to these synods with wcaponS, so that pitched battles used to be
fought between them, and many used to be slain 3 so that many 61115 ensued to Erin
from this, namely. the Boar-mor‘. and the very great dearth, and many diseases ; and

their learned editor understands it as equivalent to
“ Gal-aih, pontifex‚'' Sto. (vol, i. p* 324). Such an
interpretation would stand, if there were 311 ,1. or i. e.
before Gerailt. The passage plainly states that ‘¹ the
ssishop of Mnyo-Saxonum of Geram diedss' and this
addition of Gerald's name is a prolepsis. The Life
of St. Gerald states that he came to lreland accom-
panied by three brothers, one of whom was Beriker-
tus* He was the St. Beretehert of 'ruach-leis, now
Tullylease, in the county of Cork, whose day in the
calendar is Dec. 6, and whose obit is entered iu the
Four Masters at 839. If this date be correct, St.
Gerald must come down 1ο cire. 800.
