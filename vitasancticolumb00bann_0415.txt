who places his removal to Seotland at 56 ς, the length of his pilgrimage 32 years, and
his death, when he was about 77 years of agem.

But against this evidence may be alleged the authority of Tighernach‚ who records
Quies Colzcz'mcille in nocte Domindca Pentecostes v. Id. szz'z', armo pereyrz'naec‘om‘s Sue
xxxv. etatis vero lxxvii. With this statement, that he died on Whitsunday, agree 1111·
ancient Irish Life, cited in note ⁴², p. 234, supra, and the N aemhsenchas, which, under
the saint's name, has Cp} eenssccnoip Cotummux: (1 gen, α boclup, (1 bor, ¹ Three
Pentecosts [quinquagesimas] of colam-eine: his birthfl, his baptism, and his death.'
Now, in 597, Whitsunday fell on the znd of June, but in 596 on the 10th. If, 111010-
fore, the Whitsun clement enter into the ealculation, the year of the death must be
assigned to 596, and Adamnan's mode of eomputation be inverted; for, in this ease,
the midnight between Saturday and Sunday must be attracted to thc former in order
to fit the obit into the 9th, while, at the same time, an opposite process must be adopted
in order to identify the occurrence with the ensuing Pentecost. This date, which seems
to follow from 'righemaeh‚ is adopted by Hermannus Contractus, who places St. Co-
lumba's death at 596. But it is opposed to Tigheniach's own ealculation, who assigns
the saint’s birth to 520, and allows him an age of 77 years. Dr. Lanigan accounts for
this discrepancy by supposing that “ Tighernach was, probably, prepossessed with the
idea that 596 was the real year of his death, as he might have found it marked in some
older annaJS, which, however, considering their mode of computation‚ waS, in fact, the
samo as 597. Then, finding that Pentecost fell in 596 about the 9th of June, he sup-
posed it to be the Sunday 011 which Columba died”⁰. Or, it may bc urged that, as
Columba’s removal to Britain is said by somc to have been at Whitsuntide, Prima ⁷201?
ejus 2'72 Albam in Pentecosten& an even period was assigned to the term of his pilgrimagc,
the ehronicler being desirous to square the matter, by placing the obit at the same festi-
val. It is further to be observed that, supposing Whitsunday to have been on the znd,
which it most probably was, the saint's decease was inside the week‚ and was thus
within the octave of W'hitsuntide3 for the festival of Trim‘ty Sunday was not yct insti-
tutedq, and Easter and Pentecost were the two great ecclesiastiea] seasons of the year.
Dr. Lanigan very justly observes, that “ Adamnan, who mentions more thau 01100 this
obituary Sunday, never calls it Pentecost, which, had it been so, he would assuredly
have notieed as a very remarkable circumstance, combining the saint’s removal to
heaven with the celebration of that great festivity⁷’'.
