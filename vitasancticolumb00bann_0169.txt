considerable one, as the messenger crossed it
on foot to get the boat; unless we interpret
ultra as meaning ⁵ having crossed.‘

²⁵ Celeia-Here, and iii. 15, we hare the Latin
form of the name Colga‚ while in the title we
have the Irish, in the genitive case. Colyen
is the genitive in i. 43, infla. So Cellaz'y in
the title, the genitive of Cellach, which is la-
tinized Cellachi in iii. 15, infra. Colgan, the
hagiologist's name, is properly Mac Colgan,
‘son of Colga,' which the Annals of Ulster read
Mac Colqen at 621. The subject ofthe present
anecdote is mentioned again at iii. 15, under
similar circumstances Colgan notices him in
his Acta. at Feb. 20, but adduces nothing addi-
tional of importance. He supposes him to have
been a bishop from the expression tuce dioece-
scos, possibly Colga of Kill-cholgan in Dealbh-
na-Eathra or Garrycastle. (Aet. SS. p. 381.)
Dr. Lanigan. however, observes that ‘¹ the
phrase your diocese may mean no more than the
diocese in Ireland to which Colgeus belonged,
without his being bishop os it.'’ (Eccl. Hist. ii.
p. 328.) But both suppositione. are open to this
grave objection, that diocesan episcopacy was
unknown at this period in Ireland. See the
following note. Tighernach, at 622, records
the death os Colya mac Ceallaiy. So Ann. Ult.

same relation occur again in the Four Masters
at 776, 849. The word eidem refers to the
name in the titulus, and proves the genuine-
ness of it. The Bollandists, who have thrown

all these chapters into a continuous narrative,
and have discarded the tituli, so as not to inter-
rupt the tenor, occasionally create a defect in
their text, by omitting, as iu the present in-
stance, the antecedent.

b Diaeceseos.-The word used in the oldest
Irish recor-ds to denote ‘a diocese’ is parochia.
(S. Patricii Synod. 30, 34, Villanueva, pp.5‚ 6.
Paruclzia, Lib. Armac. fol. 11 a h, 16 α α, 20 b b,
21 ὀ b, 22 α a.) Sulpicius Severus uses dioecesis
in the sense of ‘parish‚' and parochia of ‘an
episcopal seat.' (Vit. S. Martini, Lib. Armac.
sol. 209b b. 220 aa, zozbb; pp. 578, 526, 550,
Ed. Hornii.) In the present instance tbe term
dioecesis seems, like the Greek διοίκησις, to be
taken in the sense of ‘administrationff or, sc-
condarily, of ⁶ districts conveying the idea
expressed by “quidam de provincialibus tuis
clericis‚'' iii. 7 insm. ln this sense it is eni<
ployed in tbe solitary instance in which it
occurs in the ancient mcmoirs of St. Patrick in
the Book of Armagh (fol. 20 h b). In the ease
οἳ widely extended monastic systemS, like that
os St. Columba, while the supreme government
was vested in the superior ofthe mother church,
there were local adniinistrators, under whose
direction the ehurches of a particular district
or province were unitedly placed, and the pre*
sent expression seems to have reference to such
jurisdiction. Occasionally we read, in the An-
nals, ofthe ΠἸοοῐι municipe Dotpssicc, ¹ Stew-
ard of the congregation of S. Patrick,’ in a
certain province. See Eccles. Antiqq, of Down
