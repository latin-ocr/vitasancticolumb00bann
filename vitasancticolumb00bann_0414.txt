3 1 0 A dditional N otes. [L.

Martyrology, as well as those of Bedee and Notker, we have domestic and foreign testi-
monies ngreeing with the date which has been observet} for the 5010011111)- within the
memory of man. We leam, however, from Adamnan the following partieulars, which,
taken in conjunction with the date of the festival, determine the year with great pre-
eision :—

1. Satmday was the last day of the saint's lifed.

. He had attended the nocturnal vigils0.

81101115γ after midnight he rose for matins'.

Which was the second service of Sunday.

. And just as the brethren had assembledss.

. While it was still dai-k in the oratory, for his attendant was obliged to feel after
him, and was unable to diseem his condition till lantonis were brought.

7. That this portion of the twenty-four hours was called the m'yht of Sandayh.

8. That, therefore, 110 died on Sunday.

9. That the ninth of June fell on Sunday.

Now the Regular letter of the ninth of June is f ; therefore F was the Sunday letter
of the year. But 597 is the only year at this period to which F belongs, that is, whose
first of J anuary fell on Tuesday. Thus, as far as Adamnan's statements go, the infer-
0000 is very explicit, and we arc freed from the uncezta'mty which Ussher expresses :
‘⁴ Cum media nocte Romani civiles suos dics ct incipere soleant et terminare: 111101 nox
issa media, qua Columbam decessisse diximus, diem Junii nonum vel inchoaverit vel
finierit, quaestionis quid habet''³. With regard to Adamnau’s language, there cannot
be any uncertainty3 for he represents the saint as say-ing, while it was yet Saturday,
‘¹ hac sequenti media venerabili Dominica 00010 patrum gradiar Viamst and states of
the penultimate service which he attendffl, “ Sanetus ad vespertinalem Dominicae noctis
missam ingreditur eeclesiam.'' Adamnan reckons his day from sunset 10 sunset, and
thus wc find him, on more than one occasion, employing a νυχθήμερον, and making the
night of a festival precede the dayj. See ii. 45 (p. 181), iii. 11 (p. 210), 12 (p. 211),
23 (230, 233). With this (late agree the biographer's chronological notes, who states
that St. Columba passed over to Britain in the second year 01101 the battle of Culdreibhne,
that is, in 563, being then 42 years old& and that he died, haxing completed 34 years
in his pilgrimagffl, thus giving 597 for his obit, and 76 years for his age. So also Bede,
