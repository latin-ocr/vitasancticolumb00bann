The writing is in double columns. The pages are generally marked across
with horizontal ruled lines drawn by a sharp instrument¹, and the columns are
defined by perpendicular lines of the same kind, always leaving the column on
the left narrowcr than that on the right. The volume is probably in the
original binding: the sides are beech-wood‚ greatly worm-caten, covered with
calf-skin3 thc sewing of the back is very rude and curious, and the front was
lbrmcrly secured by clasps.

A very remarkable feature of this manuscript is the copy of the Lord’s
Praycr‚ written on the last page, if not by the same hand, at least by one of
the same age and school. It exhibite the Greek character adopted by the
Irish, in its mediusoular or semi-uncial state, and in orthography fully comes
up to Kustcr's critiquem on the Irish MS. of the Pauline Epistles, called the
Codex Bam-nerianus : ‘⁶ Librarium nactus est valde imperitum et oscitantem?
It exhibits in a marked manner the same disregard of quantity which is ob-
scrvablc iu the Greek letters and in the Book of Armagh, and in the old
metrical Latin of theIrish3 as well as in the words HHPICTHPA for περισ-
τερα”, and CHKVNAVC for secundus, in the body of the manuscript. The
following represents its orthography and division in ordinary letters z—Harnp

which 1000 years has made but little change.
In the 25th of St. Matthew⁷ at the top of fol.
48 bb, there are two lines where the ink is ex-
tremely pale, probably owing to some diluent
used b)- thc writer, for there is an error at the
place.

¹ Slzarp instrument.-This kind of ruling is
common in Irish MSS. See Rettig's account
of the ruling os the Codex Sangallensis, Pro-
legom. p. x. (Turici, 1836). In the Book of
Armagh the ruling of the Gospels‚ which are
written with great delieaey, does not catch the
eye3 but in the Epistles it is very distinct, and
the little incisious along the outer marginal
lines, marking out the spaces for the horizonta!
lines, are very plain, especially on the first leaf
of the quaternio, showing that one process

connexion with the ruling⁷ this remarkable fea-
ture in the second part of the Book of Armagh.
that the writing hanysfrom, instead of restiny
οη, the line. This was a peculiarity of Oriental
writing, and was adopted by the Irish sor con-
venience, inasmuch as the upper part of many
oftheir letters, as p. 5, ῃ, Γ, τ, coincided better
with a horizonta} line than the lower. The two
volumes os Doomsday in the Chapter House at
Westminster afford a medieval illustration of
the marginal spaciug, and the ruling with a
pointed instrument.
