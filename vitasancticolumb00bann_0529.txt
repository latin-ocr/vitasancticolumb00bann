dykes” (iii. 2 58). At the end of this is the spot called Kz‘ll ma qlwbhanabz. Graham
calls this embankmcnt, the Bislzop’s Walk (Iona, p. 4).

2. Cnoc-na-nAinqel, commonly called Sz'mean Mor, or ‘ Great Fahy-mount's. This
is Adamnan's Gallicum Anqelorum (17 ς, 218). It is a smooth, green knoll, about 167
paces in circumference at the base. Pennant says of it: “On the right hand, on a
small hill, a small circle of 5101105, and a little caim in the middle, evidently druidieal,
but called the hill of the cmyels, onoc-nan-ainqeal ,· from a tradition that the holy man
had there a conference with those celestia] beings soon after his arrival. Bishop Poeock
informed me that 1110 1111111105 were accustomed to bring their horses to this circle at the
feast of St. Michael, and to course round it’⁷ (iii. p. 2 58).

3. Port-an- Ghuraz'ch derives its name from a long, low mound, running across the
bay, near high-water mmk. It has long been an object of curiosity to trave-flers.
Martin says of it :—“ The DocK which was dug ont of Port Churielz, 15 011 1110 shoar, to
preserve Columbus’s Boat called Curiclc'' (p. 263). A writer of 170¹ observes :—“ This
harbour 15 called Part-a-churrz'ch, from the ship that Calimij and his associats came
upon from heland to that place. The length of the curnehun or ship 15 obvious to
any one who goes 1ο 1110 place, it being marked up att the head of ‘the harbour upon
the ἰ«111155, between two little pillars of stons, set up 10 show forth γε samain, between
which pfflars there 15 three score of foots 111 length, which was the exact length of the
curaohan or ship” (N ew Stat. Acet. vol. vii. pt. z, p. 316). This bay 15 exposed to
1110 western swell of tho Atlantic, and 15 very dangerous except in fine weather (ib.)

4. Opposite the centre of Martyr's Bay is a mound called by the natives Εαῖα, ‘ the
swan' (Graham, p. 3); why, they cannot tell. But the 111111115, that they are misled by
the sound, for the word really is eotacpom, ‘ a eoffin’2, and so applied because funeral
parties 011 landing were formerly 111 1110 habit of laying the remains upon this mound,
While they thricc performed a deisiol, 01· right-wisc circuit, round the spot.

5. Torr Αὒῖ), a rocky eminenee opposite the west entrance of the Cathedral, outsidc
the enclosure. “To the west of the convent 15 1110 abbot's mount, overlooking the
whole'' (Pennant, iii. p. 258). This must be the site of what Martin describes, when,
speaking of St. Martin's Cross, he says :—“ At a little further distance is Dua Ni Mm-
ich, i. c. Monks-Fort, built of Stone and Lime, 'm form of a Bastion, pretty high.

² Coffin.—The Irish word eolsscponi, *a bier,¹
is possibly from the Latin feretrum. At Port-na-
marbh, the mortal remains of those who are conveyed
for interment to Hy, are brought ashore, and are de-
posited on the mound (Ul. ι10111. Arch. i. p. 80).
