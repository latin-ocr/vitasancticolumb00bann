pline' or ‘observance'k; while the mention of written rules¹ is rare and legendary.
There certainly existed, in the middle ages, not only a great diversity in monastic
practicem, but also an understanding that the fathers of the Irish Church had established
and defined a variety of orders. An ancient Life of Ciaran of Clonmacnois 11111115
them to eight, and enumerates them under the names of “ S. Patricii, Brandani, Kie-
ram' Cluanensis, Columbae Hiensis, eujus ordo dicebatur Pulchrae societatis, Comgaffl,
Adamnam', Brigidae, Molassi seu Lasriani'⁷¹²; but the recital is evidently arbitr-ary:
for St. Adamnan, instead of being the author of a new Rule, was unable to induce the
society of which he was ninth abbot to accept the reformed Paschal canon. Possi-
bly, the biographer supposed, as did Ussher⁰ in a later age, and others after him, that
the Lex of Adamnan, Patrick, Ciaran, Brendan, &c., mentioned in the Irish Annals,
denoted formulas of monastic government. Ussher further states that the Rules of
Columbakilli, Comgall, Mochutta, and Albe were extant in the manuscript from which
he published 1115 catalogue of the saints, but “ Hibernico sermone antiquissimo exaratae
et nostris temporibus pene ignorabfls’v. It was probably from this or a similar col-
lection that the Irish Rules, preserved in the Bmssels MS„ were transcribed. Through
the exertions of the Rev. Dr. Todd, copies of them have been obtained in this country,
and by his kind permission the present wn'ter was enabled, in 18 50, to print the Rulc
of st. Columba in the Appendix to Colton's Visitation of Derry (p. 109). It differs
from the others in being written in prose. They are au very ancient compositions,
but totally insufficicnt to convey any definite idea of the peculiaritics of thc orders to
which they profess respectively to belong. Colgan, who lived before the dispersion of
Irish records, and had the best opportunity of discovering such literary monuments,
was not awarc of thc existence of any other Rulc of St. Columba but the one just 111011-
tioned‘, and it is erident that he attached but little importance to it, as he has omitted
