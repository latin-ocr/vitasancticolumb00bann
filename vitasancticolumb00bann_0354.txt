the territory of Cinel Gonafll Gulban3 and

The record of the battle in the Annals of the Four Masters, at the year 555, is as

followsz—“The sevcnteenth year of Dimmnjd.

The battle of Cui—Dreirnhne was

gained against Diamajd, son 01⁰ Cearbhall, by Fearghus and Domhnall, the two sons
of Muirchearthuh, son of E;1rca; by Ainmirc, son of Sedna; {md by Nainnidh, son of

were supposed to have produced so marvellous a result.

Diam-ait, who was now on the throne²‚ was the head of the Southern branch of the
Hy-Neill raee; and the chjcfs of the two main sections of the N orthem branc-h, namely,
the Cinel Eoghain and Cinel Conaffl, had already distinguished themselves by military

accordingly translates this curicus passage with
studied inaccuracy: “ carbach, id est, praeliator,

tio cum debita reverentia circumducatur. eveniat, ut
