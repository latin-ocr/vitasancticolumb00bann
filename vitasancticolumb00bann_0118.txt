succeeded to the throne of Deira3 and, in 635.
slew Eanfrid, King of Bernieia, Oswald's eldest
brother. Proceeding to lay waste Northum-
bria, he encountered Oswald, on whom the
united government had devolved, and was slaiu
in battle—See note 2, p. 16 infra.

¹· Callonem—‘⁶ Caedua11a‚ quamvis nomen et
professionem haberet Christiani, adeo tamen
erat auimo ac moribus barbarus, ut ne sexui
quidem muliebri, vel innocuae parvulorum par-
ceret aetati, quin universos atrocitate ferina
morti per tormenta contraderet, multo tempore
totas eorum provincias debacchando pervaga-
tus. ac totum genus Anglorum Brittaniae finibus
erasurum se esse deliberans.”-(Bede, H. E.
ii. 20.) The battle of Haethfelth, under its
British name. is thus recorded by Nennius:
⁸* Duo filii Edguiin erant‚ et cum ipso corrue-
runt in bello ΛῙείι-εη, et de origine illius nun-
quam iteratum ost regnum, quia nou evasit
unus de genere illius de isto bello, sed inter-
fecti omnes sunt cum illo ab exercitu Catguol-
launi, regis Guendotae regionis.’'—(Hist. Brit.
§GL Ed. stov.) Bode and the Saxon Chro-
nicle give 633 as the date, hut Tighernach 631,
and the Annals of Ulster, and of Cambria 630:

Ρ Alta proceritas.—Though the ⁴⁴ nota major
imago*¹ was of old an acknowledged property
of the shades (Virgil, AEn. ii. 7733 Ovid, Fast.
ii. 503; Juvenal, xiii. 221 ; Tacitus, Ann. xi. 21 ς
Hist. i. 86), it might be that Oswald, fresh from
Scotland, and probably from Iona, was im-
pressed by the description he had heard of S.
Columba’s personal appearance, which, being
matter of only thirty-six ⁴years' tradition,
was likely to be fresh and true. He had
heard that the saint had mingled a good deal
in military matters before his departure from
lreland, and that he had the credit of more than
once turning the scale of victory by his prayers.
The tradition of S. Columba's great stature
may subsequently have given a character to
the vision which Alexander ΙΙ. saw in the
island of Kerara, when on his way against
Haeo, in 1263: ‘¹ King Alexander‚then lying in
Kiararey Sound‚ dreamed a dream, and thought
three men came to him. He thought one of
them was in royal robes, but very stet-n, ruddy
in countenance, something thick, aud of mid-
ling size. Another seemed of a slender make,
but active, and of all men the most engaging,
and majestic. The third again, was of very
yreat stature, but his features were distorted,
and os all the rest he was the most unsightly.
The Hebridians say that the men whom the
King saw in his sleep were St. Olave King of
Norway7 St. Magnus Earl of Orkney, and St.
Columba.'’—(Norw. Account of Haeo*s Expe-
dition, by Johnstone pp. 10-13.)
