Brecbannach seems to be formed from bpeoc 11800001ῧό8, ‘ maculosum benedictum'w,
and denoted something like the bpsscueu bpeoe-mep5eooo, pallia maeulatorum vexil-
lorum, which were carried in the battle of Magh Rath& The Brecbannaoh probably
servod a double purpose, being, like the Banner of Cuthbert, ‘⁴ shewed and canied in
the abbey on festivali and principali daies,'’ and also “presented and carried to any
battle, as occasion should serve'’5. whence King Wffliam obtained the reliquary is
not stated. Probably it had been kept in tho parish of Forglen by the heredjtary ten-
ants of the chmch lands. Between 1 172 and 1 180 the king granted to the Canons of
Holyrood the rights, tithes, and obventions of four churohes in Cantyre, which had

the Abbot of Armagh, cum leye et vexillis patricii.
At 810, armario is the equivalent for vexillis. The
Life of S. Columba of Tirdaglass states that he vis-
ited Tours, and received certain reliquaries which
were taken from St. Martlu's tomb, agreeably to the
saiut's injunctions: “Ponite ergo istud crismale et
trabem juxta me in scrinio, quia hec vexilla hospes
ille a nobis postulabit, et dabitis illi.⁷' (Cod. Sal-
mant. fol. 130 α b.) After Kiug Oswald's transla-
