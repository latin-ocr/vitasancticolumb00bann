Another account of the origin of this ancient manuscript (for that such a book,
whether Martin⁷s or Patrick's, was preserved in the diocese of Derry, is unquestionable)
is, that it had belonged to st. Patrick, who, as the Tripartite Life says, when ‘¹ morti
vicinus, librum Evangehomm, quo ipse dum viveret, utebatur, illi velut Euangelii ob-
servantissimo cultori, testamento legaverit, ex suo etiam in Ardmachja successori man-
daverit certam quotannis pensionem pro eodem seponere. Praefatus vero Euangelio-

quas manus incideret, conditus existimatur’'⁰. To the discovery of the manuscript in
St. Patrick’s grave, the following entry in the Annals of Ulster, copied from a chro-

The relies of Patriek were enshrined
sixty years after his death by Columcille.
Three precious reliquaries were found in
the tomb, se. the Cup, the Angel's Gos-
pel, and the Bell of the Willp. The angel
directed Columcille to divide the three re-
liquaries thus : the Cup to Down, the Bell
of the Will to Aia-magii, the *Gospel of the
Angel to Columcille himself. And it is
called the Gospel of the Angel, because
Columeille receivedq it at the Angel's
hand.

O'Donnell has transferred this anecdote into his narrative‘‚ Which Colgan has im·

perfectly translateffl. That the Gospel of St. Martin and the Gospel of the Ange] were
supposed to be identicaL appears from a poem in the Laud MS. (p. 81) beginning
Cmpcpmcep mo pou-cetu, ‘My gospel shall be preserved‚’ in which St. Patrick is
represented as describing the future greatness and holiness of St. Columba; where the
gloss remarks that the Gospel of St. Martin is alluded to.
