dependent authority, one of which professes to follow a Scotch transcript.
To which may be added, that Fordunm and O’Donnelln used and received the
longer text, as is proved by their citing passages which do not exist in the
shorter. The style of Adamnan is apparent in these extra portions, and the
arrangement of the Chapters in the longer text agrees better with the character
of his other work. This view is confirmed by the consideration that the
shorter text owes its peenliar character, as least as far as regards the absence
oftitles and the fewness of proper nameS‚ to an assignable cause, namely, the
convenience oscongregational reading, as expressed in St. Benedict’s Rule0:
“ Ideo omni tempore, sive jejunii sive prandii, mox ut surrexerint a coena,
sedeant omnes in unum, et legat unus Collationes, vel Vitas Patmm, aut certe
aliquid quod aedificet audientes” (cap. 42). Itis reasonable to suppose that
the interruption of the narrative by tisses, or the incumbering of it with proper
names, would be avoided as opposed to the purpose of edification 3 hence, con-
sidering the longer lnemoir to be the genuine one, it is easy to imagine the
creation osan abbreviated text, and this revision becoming the favourite one
for conventual reading.

But the shorter <text possesses internal evidence that such a reduction
has taken place. The second Preface declares the author's intentionp to give
at the outset of his menioir a summary of the wonders contained in it, which
was to serve as a foretaste for those whose eagerness to learn something of the
Saint would not wait for the patient perusal of the whole. Now, this promise
is fulfilled¹1 in the first chapter of the longer text, but is left unaccomplished in
the shorter. Again‚ the fortieth chapter of the first book places St. Columba
‘⁴ in Scotiensium paulo superius memorata regione‚⁷’ and then goes on to speak
of Trioit‚ a place now known as Trevet‚ in the county of Meath. In the longer

from the fuller eopy; so in eap.41, from i. 10;
in cap. 42, he borrows from i, ι, the whole pas-
sage about Oswald, which is wanting iu the
shorter copies, and introduces it thus: ⁴⁴ Quem
Beda Caedwallam, quem et Adamnanus Cath-
lonem in sua chronica appellat.'' In cap. 49 he
refers to it again. He probably used the text
of the Cotton MS. Tiberius D. iii. Brit. Mus.
