which was printed in Paris in ¹734· Accordingly, the Bouandjstsk place the comme-
moration of “ S. Eunanus Episcopus, Confessor, Raphoae in Hibernia‚” at Sept. vii„ in
a short notice edited by J oannes Sfflt'mgus. Alban Butler¹, following this authority,
repeats the error at the same day; and in the Irish Calendar appended to the Dublin
editionm of his valuable book, the same fictitions patron iutrudes on another saint's
day. St. Adamnan’s bedu used to be shown at Raphoc.

2. Skreen.--A parish church of the diocese of Kfflala, in the county of Sligo,
barony of Tireragh, bounded on the north by Sligo Bay. The site of the ehureh is an
old grant. Tho Life of Farannan⁰ relates that Tibraide [son of Maelduin, Lord of Hy-
Fiachrach] bestowed upon St. Columba and his fraternity three pleasant pontions of
ground, one of which ‘⁶ loeus isto aevo Cnoc-na-maoilep dicebatur, postea a S. Adamnano
Abbate, Scrin-Adhamhnain, i. e. Scrinium S. Adamnani dietusfi St.Ada.innan is locally
called Arc-naun, and his well is situated a little to the east of the old church‚ at the other
side of the road. From this well the townland Toberawnaun [Cobop Gourimmn] derives
its name, between which and the tow-uland Soodry runs the Dunmoran stream. Over
this rivulet, in connexion with a horem, is the Drelze‘d Azcnazm, or ‘ Bridge of Adam-
nan‚’ formed of a flag nine feet long, and nine inches broad, resting on two stones in
the bed of the stream, two feet high. It does not fill the whole breadth of the stream,
so that at either end there is a vacant space between it and the bank. The nat-ircs say
it was formed hythe saint, for his convenience in going from his church to the strand:

the diocese of Raphoe, St. Eunan is generally con-
sidered to be a different individual from Adamnan,
and the error derives support from the custom which
prevailed of holding the commemoration of St.
Eunan as patron ot* the diocese on the 7th of Sep-
tembcr.

“The monastery founded there by St. Columb, and
restored by St. Adamnan, being convertcd into an
