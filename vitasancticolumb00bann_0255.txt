Quod ut

cognovit homo Dei, cum comitibusc ad valvas portarum accedens, in primis
Dominicae crucis imprimens signum, tum deinde manum pulsans contra ostia

ux. annis regnavit. In octavo anno regni
ejus baptizatus est a sancto Columba.’⁷ (Irish
Nennius, p. 163.) Ussher, following Hermannus
Contractus, who borrowed from Bede, places
the accession os Brudeus at 557 (Wks. vol. vi.
Iud. Chron0I., and p. 234); 1nnes7 ayear earlier
(Civ. Eccl. Hist. p. ¹93) ; but both dates are
too late, for Brudeus died in 584 (Tigh. An.
Ult. 5833 Ussher, Ind. Chr. 584), and subtract-
ing 30, the length of his reign, we are brought
back to 554 sor its commeneement3 and thus
563, the true year of St. Columba's removal to
Britain, is found to be the ninlh of Brudeus’
reign. According to this computation, the
regnal year in the Chron. Pict. is incorrect,
unless we suppose the present visit to have
taken place in 562, the year before the occu-
pation of Hy. It is very possible that this
visit to Brudeus may have becn prcliminary to
the final settlement in that island. The Scots
having been already converted. the missionary
spirit. and a desire to conciliate the favour of
powerful nfflgbbours, would naturally lead St.
Columba in their dircetion, and thus we could
easily reconcile thc rival statements of Bede
and Tighernach as to the donation of Hy;
concerning which Professor Husscy reasonably
observes: ‘⁶ Si unquam dejure et possessione
hujus insulae certatum erat inter illos reges,
satis causae haberemus cur adeo diverse a di-
versis auctoribus traditum sit.'⁷ (Bedae. Hist.
Eccl. p. 122.) We may fix on 563 as the most
probable date of the occurrence recorded in
the text.

¹³ Suae munitionz's.—Meuti0ned already in i.
37 (p. 73). From chap. 33, snpra, where we find
domus reyc'a, aula reqia, and reqis munitio, we
learn that it. was at some distance, though not
far, from the banks of the river Ness. Now,
as this river has a very limitet] course. the

circuit ofinquiry for the situation of the dun is
greatly narrowed3 and there being but one
spot within it which is answerable to the name.
the identification may be regarded as nearly
certain. Craiy Plzadrick, situate about two miles
S. W. of Inverness, across the river, is a natu-
ral eminence of considerable height, and well
defined. On the summit is a level space of an
oval form, about 240 yards in circumference.
enclosed by a parapet, which, though very
much reduced in height and regularsty, and
ovcrgrown with vegetable matter, still affords
satisfactory evidence ofits original outline, aud
of the solidifleation of its parts by the action
of fire. Itis oue of those rude structures called
Vitrified Fores, and which are regarded by
some as peculial· to the old Pictish inhabitants.
The summit is 435 feet above the level of the
sea, and commands, where the ill-judgod and
injurious' plantation with which it is crowned
permits‚ a most beautiful and extensive pros-
pect, having a large tract of Rosshire on the
north, Inverness on the east, Beauly on the
west, and Loch Ness on the south. The as-
cent of the hill is rendered difficult by thc
dense plantation with which its sides arc
eloxhed, a species of ornament better suited
to the neighbouring cminenee of Tom-na-hou-
rich than to the hill-fort of the Pictish kings.
There is an interesting description of Craig
Phadrick, accompanied by a sketch and sec-
tion, in “An Account of some remarkable
Ancient Ruins iu the Highlands, by John Wil
liams'’ (Edinb. 1777), p. 31. The lncmoir of
Inverness parisii in the old Statistical Survey
gives but a meagre account of this curiuus
fort (vol. ix. pp* 610, 634).
