fies ‘a stony place‚' is of such frequent occur-
rence, that among the townland names in Ire-
land there are no less than forty-fi ve instance-s
of Cloyher, and forty-two of the same word in
composition. The nucleus of the settlemcnt
mentioned in the text was the earthen sort in
the episcopal demesne, which was anciently
called Rath-mor fllaiyhe-Leamltna, aud was
said to have been constructed iu the beginning
of the second century by Baine, wife of Kiug
Tuathal Teachtmar (Four Mast. 111 ; O’Fla-
lierty, Ogygia, p. 303). lt afterwards became
the seat of the kings of Airghialla, and when
St. Maeearthen founded the see of Clogher in
this place, it was in complianee with the in-
structions of St. Patrick: ‘⁴ Vade in pace fili,
et monasterium tibi construe in platea ante
regalem sedem Urgallensium.” (Colg. Act. SS.
p. 738 b, e. 7.) Hence it was that this church,
being grafted on the lordship, acquired prece-
dence in the domininus of Airghialla‚ so that
in after ages episcopus Erqalliae became a
common designation of the bishops of Clogher.
The filii Daimeni, from whom the place took
its distinctive name, were sons of Damhin, son
of Cairbre Damhairgid⁷ King of Airghialla,
and were called the Clann Damltiu (Ogyg.
p. 365); whose descendants retained the name,
and were represented in 1353 by the family of
Duibfflfire, now Dwyer (Cambrens. Evers. vol.
i. p. 246 reprimi). Mugania was 1n5en Ooniun,
‘daughter of Damhin.' The following table

There was also a Clunn, or Cinel-Fiacln de-
rived from Tuathal, son of Niall, who were
settled near Clogher. ‘⁶ Daimhin Drech—argaid
[silver face], i. e. Tuathalan of the North, had
seven sons in Feara Leamhna, and it is they.
who are called the Sil Tuatlzaz'l at Clochar-
mac-Daimhin. Others say that these sons who
are about Clochar were not the sons ofTuathal‚
but of Daimhin Dreeh-airgid. This, however.
is not correct, for they were sons to Tuathal of
the North, and this Tuathal was called Daim-
hin.''—Mac Firbis, Geneal. MS. p. 169. The
name Damhin is the diminutive os Damlz, ⁴bos,'
and may be rendered Vitulus. See Colg. Aet.
