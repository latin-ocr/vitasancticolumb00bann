Memoir of St. A damnem. xlix

King Finnaehta, had inem-red, if the bardic accounts are to be ereditetl, the displeasure
of the Hy Nem moe, by impairing the honours which 110 was expected to riphold, 111
remitting to the Leinster-men the tribute. which they had been in the habit of annually
paying to the chief of the existing dynasty. Finnachta had fought the Lagenians and
routed them, so that his indulgence to them docs not seem to haye been extorted by
force. The secret probably lies in the monarch's title of F ledac‘lzy or ¹ the Festive.’
Poems ascribe the exemption to the pleading of St. Mofing, a Leinster ecclesiastic of
great celebrity, who took advantage of the ambiguous meaning of the word Luem,
Which is either Monday, or the (lay os jzcdqment, to convert the term of a temporary
respite into a perpetual sui-render of the claim. Adamnan gets thc credit of being the
great champion for the maintenanec of the demand; and a 1100111ἰ of 501110 length and
flre is attributed to him, wherein he calls Finnaehta m 1¹13 epm 11οὑ 0οη occu. ‘the
old grey king without teeth,‘ and indulges in such sentiments as these :—

⁴¹ Werc I a king of reddened spears
Ι would humble mine enemies,
I would exalt my high places,
My combats should be frequentl'

The Irish Life of Adamnan says that a proclamation had been made by Finnaehta to
the effect, that the lands of Columeille should not enjoy the same privileges as those
of Patriok, Fimfflm, and Ciaran, whereupon Adainnan said: “ The life of the king
who made this proelamation shall bc short; he shall fau by fratria—idm :nid there shall
be no king of his racc for ever.'’ Finnachta fell by the hand of his cousin 111 695.
Dming his sojourn in Irelund, Adamnan in au probability exerted himself strenu-
ously 111 the propagation of the new Easter observance, and laid the foundation 01111(-
great success which afterwards uttended his recommendation of the subject in this
his native country. His stay, however, was not of long continuam-e, for we find him
returnz'nffl to Ireland in 697, in order to legislate. for the peoplc. It was probably 111
the interval of these two journeys that 110 compiled his Life of St. Columba, for the
use of his society. In it he makes no reference to the difference of sentiment between
himself and his congregation on the paschal question3 but there is an allusion to a
sore subject, where hc tells of St. Columba‘s propheey at Clonmacnoise eoncerning the
(11500111, “quae post dies multos ob diversitatem Paschalis festi orta est inter Seotiae
eeclesias'’ (p. 26). He may have resen-cd to the same subject when hc spoke of the
“ valde stolidi qui ingrati Dei patientia male abutuntur” (p. 184). Baert conjectured
that the Life was written during Adamnan's last sojourn in Ireland, and that the
brethren, at whose instance hc professes to write, were not the refractory monks of
Hy, but the more amenable inmates of Durrow, and of the kindred associations in
