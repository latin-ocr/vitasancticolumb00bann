bency, derived from the Annals, and the day of 1115 death as entered in the calendar.

the notices of the Columbian houses, and the particulars of early Soottish history which
are entered in the Irish Annals, are arranged in order under the abbot’s name in whose
term of office they occurred, as nearly as the brevity of the plan would admit, in the words
of the Annals of OEstcr, with the addition of a year to their current date-33 or of any other
authority which is drawn upon for supplementary informat-ion. Wherc the passages have
been aheady cited 111 this work, a parenthetic reference to the page will be sufficient.
