in- Moy-linnyn and a, devoted ffiend of the saint. He was an enterprising chief, and in
573: won the battle of Tola 111 the King’s County. 111 589 110 became king of maim
and in 594 won the battle of Edan-mor from the Ciannachta of Meath. In 597 110,
won the battle of Sliabh Cua in waterford ; and 111 602 that of Cuil-caol in Down. 111
623 he took Rath-Guala 111 Uladh3 and fell at the battle of Leth-Midhin in 626. Now,
supposing that he had taken part 111 the battle of Cui-rathain before St. Columba’s de-
parture, that 15, 1110 year 563, a period of 63 would have intervened between that und
his last aehicvement, a suspicions interval 111 a warrior's life. That the battle of 0111-
rathain, though not recorded in the Annals, was fought‚—that he was a leader therein,
—and that it took place in consequence of the jealousies of the Dalaradians and the
Hy Nom, quickened into aetion by the influonee of their respective arch-ecclesiastics,
15 extremely probable: only it was a military event which followed, not preceded, St„
Columba’s settlement in Hy. i

The third battle, that of Cul-fedha or Bealach-fedhaw‚ was fought 111 587, and is
thus recorded by Tighcrnach :—

This battle, as well as that of Cul-Dremlme, was between the Northern and
Southern branches of the Hy Neill. It was fought by Aedh, 5011 of Ainmire, to
arengo the death of Bacdan, son of Ninnidh, monarch of Ireland, who had been slain
by 00111100, 5011 of Colman Beg, and 1115 second cousin Cumine, 5011 of Libran, 0110110-
111-01011, under the instigation of Colman Beg. How far St. Columba participated in
thie transaction is not recorded, but that 110 was deeply interestcd in it appears evident
from the words of Tighernach, a sentiment which the Four Masters studiously sup-
press. The relation which existed between the leaders in this battle, and between
them and St. Columba, will be seen at a glance 111 the genealogica] table above.
