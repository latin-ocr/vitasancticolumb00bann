totally neglected, bearing neither title nor numbe1·.’' It was twice borrowed
by Dr. Keller, and on the latter occasion, in 1 85 1 , he made a valuable collection

of sacsimiles from it, and through Mr. Mors, a person of considerable learning
and experience in manuscripts, secured a most minute collation of the text
with the printed edition in the Bollandists‚ the results of which, with the
greatest kinduess and liberality, he placed at the service of the present editor.

11. Codex B. A vellum MS. of the middle of the fifteenth century, pre-
served in the British Muscum, Bibl. Rey. 8 D. ix. The text agrees in its
main features with that of A. It has, however, capitulationes for the second
and third books, which do not exist in A, and a paragraph in the middle of
the second book (ii. 20). These have been introduced into the present work
(pp. 100, 188, 131). It also contains a recital of the names of St. Columba’s
twelve disciples, and ofhis immediate kinsmen. This appendage‚ which comes
without a break immediately after the text in the manuscript, is not an integral
part of the work3 but as it is evidently very ancient and trustworthy‚ it forms
the subject of Additional Note A (pp. 245-247) in the present work. The
manuscript wants about a quaternio at the beginning, and commences abruptly
in the middle of i. 3 (25). This defect is of old standing, for the name Lumley,
written at the foot of the first page, is the signature of John, Lord Lumleyz
who died in 1609. Otherwise, the manuscript is in unexceptionable preser-
vati0n3 the vellum clean, and the writing distinct. The capitals are large
and massive, in red and blue alternately3 those at the beginning of sections οι·
paragrapbs smaller, but coloured in like manner: the tituli are in rubric- As
