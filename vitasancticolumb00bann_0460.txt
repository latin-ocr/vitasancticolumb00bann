ains also some examples of the Greek hand²‚ which was then in vogue among the
Irish. It was a common praet-icc with them to write Latin matter in Greek lettersb
(89, 187), as is remarkably illustrated in the Book of Armaght. The style of the
letter is peculiar to the Irish school, and the family likeness can be traeed in manu-
scripts which are now found in situations very remoted from one another. It is very
probablc that a chronicle of events, especially obits²‚ was kept in the monastery (66),

ful interlinear Greek and Latin Psalter of the Irish
school preserved in the town library of Bfile (A.
vii. 3), mentioned by Wetstein (N. Test. Gr. vol. ii.
p. 9), by Dr. Todd (Book of Hymns, fascic. 1,
p. 55), and by Dr. Keller, who has printed a speci-

b Greek lettera—See p. 187, supra. The Life
of St. Brendan furnishes us with the following cu-
rious illustration of the practice: “Habebat sanctus
Gylldas missalem librum, seriptum Grecis literis.
Et possitus est ille liber super altare. Et custos
templi ex jussione sancti Gillde dixit sancto Bren-
dano, Vir Dei, precepit tibi sanctus senex noster ut
offeres corpus Christi, Ecce altare, hunc librum
Grecis literis scriptum, et canta in eo sicut abbas
noster. Accipiensque sanctus Brendanus librum
ait, Demonstra michi Domine Jhesu, istas literas
ignorans, sicut aperuisti ostia clausa aute uos.
Profecto possibilia omnia sunt eredenti. Ilico jam
literas Grecas scivit sanctus Brendanus, sicuti Lati-
nas quas didicit ab infautia. Et coepit missam can-
tare.”·-Cotl. Mai-⁵11. fol. 63 ab. On the practice of
uriting Latin in Greek characters⁷ see Dr⁴ Graves

‘¹ Remota-cod. A., formerly preserved at Rei-
chenau‚ is at present in the Town Library of Schaff-
hausen. ΤΙιε Cod. Sangallensis of the Gospels was
written by an Irish scribe3 and the Book of Armagh

MS. of St. Paul's Episths, corresponding to the
Cod. Sangallensis, after passing through various
hands between Paulus J unius and Professor Boemer.
is now in the Ros-al Library of Dresden. At foot
of fol. 23 are six lines, which have been a mystery
to all the biblical critics of the Continent, and which
the late Dr¹ Ingram of Oxford, in his ardour for the
honour of Saxon literature, endeavoured to inter-
pret. Had he succeeded in the attempt. the name
„thyla-saxon, so common a term for every literar-y
monument os the British Isles, would not have been
a misnomer for the writing of this manuscript, or
any of its school; but Saxou helped him as little in
the endeavour as [rish did a late speculator on the
Eugubiau 'suble-53 and in this case it was lest for
the Irish to assert their legitimate claim to their
national monument, and, in reading these lines with
ease and certainty, toidentify their name with many
of the most beautiful and venerable manuscripts to
be found in Europe. Keller and Zeuss have settled
the question for ever. See Irish Eccles. Journal,
vol. v. p. 138.

ε Obits.—The custom of keeping such entries is
illustrated in Bede's statement of a Saxon priest,
“egressus requisivit in annali suo, et invenit eadem
ipsa die Osualdum regem fnisse peremptum.¹'-

bably kept in all the ln'sb monasteries.
