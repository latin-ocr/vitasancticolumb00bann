“ S. Donnanus martyr cum multis sociis, ad Britanno-Hibernos profectus missis a Rege
satellitibus, qui eum interficerent, tantisper ad ejus preces cxpectarunt, donec Missam
finiret. Qua finita ipse S. Donnanus cum suis martyrio est coronatus in eodem 1000.”
To this is subj oined a Latin translation of Maguire’s gloss on the Fcilire, which has been
given above, with an English version.

Now, as to the date of the tragula writers are very much at fault: Sirinus con-
jectures that it was before 596, whereas Keith0, following Dempster¹³‚ refers Donnan'rz
florebat to so late a yearras 840. But the truc date is placed beyond any question by
the hitherto 1111110110οᾶ 01111105 111 1110 Irish Annals. Tighernach, at 617, sayS, Cum·
bustz'oq Domzain-Eqa 111 [in] xv. Kal. Masi cum CL. martiribus¹3 and the Annals of
Ulster, at 616, 111 the same words. According to the peculiar computation of the
Annals of Innisfallen, 1110 event took place in 611, at Which year they record the

of the Calends of May! According to 1110 Annals of fflster, Which are more correct in
their notation than the printed text of Tighernachs, the first of J anuary, in 617, 1110

to have occurred on Sunday, a fact which we would have been led to expect from the
mention, in the Calcnfflzrs, of his having bccn at mass at the time he was attached. It*
15, however, a mistake in 1110 Martyrology ofTamlaeht 10 say that it was on Easter
Sunday3 sor that festival, in 617, fell on April 3, and in 618, on April 16, neither 01
which, even supposing the latter to bc the true date, could coincidc with St. Donnan's
day. It 15 a remarkable test of the accur-acy of the Annals of Ulster to find a year and
a chronological note assigned for an occurrence which 15 limited by a casua] expression
111 a gloss upon thc Calendar3 and it is to the credit of that gloss, that what might be
supposed to wear the appearance of a random statement is borne out by the solid testi-
mony of veracious (111-01110105.

In process of time, the ‘island again became a religious abedo, and the Annals os
Ulster have preserved the obit 010110ι successor os St. Donnan: 724, Oan prim'zps [supr--

the Calendars. Possibly the murderers set fire to
