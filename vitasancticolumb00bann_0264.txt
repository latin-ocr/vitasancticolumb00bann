Annals (Four Mast. 593; and in composition,
ibid. 622). Itis derived from 0015, ‘a sword,’
or ‘thorn ς’ and. as an adjective, denotes ‘sharp'

The foundation of the chureh of
Det-ry by St. Columba is thus recorded in the
Annals of Ulster‚ at 545: Daire Coluim cille
ιγἰιηιίαία est. There is, however, a prolepsis in
this name, for in every other instance where
the place is mentioned in the Λητωὶς, until the
middle of the tenth century, it is called by its
original designation, Daire Calyaich. The first
time that the form Daire Coluimcille occurs in
the Four Mastcrs is at the year 950, about
which time it would seem that the memory of
the founder prevailed over the ancient name.

According to the early lrish Life, the chureh
of Derry was founded in consequence ofa grant
from King Aedh, son of Ainmire, and within
the royal precincts. Lmo Cotunn citte ionum

the royal fort of Aedh, son of Ainmire, who
was king of Erin at that time. The king of-
fered the fort to Columcille; but he refused it,
because of Mobi's command. On his coming
out of the fort, however, he met two of the
people of Mobi, bringing to him Mobi’s girdle,
with his consent that Columcille should accept
a grant of territory, Mobi having died. Co-
lumcille then settled in the sort of Aedh, and
founded a chureh there, and wrought many
miracles in it.⁷ Now it is to be observed that
Mobi Clarainech, of Glas-naoidhen‚ now Glas-
nevin‚ near Dublin, died, according to the An-
nals of Ulster, in 544, the year preceding that
to which they assign the founding os Derry.
But Aedh. son of Aiumire, was slain, as
Tighernach states, in 598, in the 63rd year ot'
his age, so that he was born in 535, and there-
fore could have been only ten years old at the
date of the alleged grant. O'Donnell, who eo-
pies this account, qualifies the statement con-
ccrning Aedh by observing: “Ejus tum loci
Princeps Aidus, filius Ainmrechi Regis Hiber-
niae; et ipse postea Rex, Dei suique cognati‚''
δια-ἰ. 48 (Tr. Th. p. 397 α). A slight addi-
tion to the age of Aedh, as given by Tigher-
nach, would represent him sufficiently advanced
in years to become the patron of St. Columba;
but even this is unnecessary, if we regard him
at the age of ten as the representative of the
rat-e, and the donation made, as the Four
Masters state (though 535, the year they as-
sign, be untenahle), ‘⁴ by his own tribe, i. e.
the race ot' Conall Gulban, son of Nialll’ The
strongest evidence in support ofthe date given
