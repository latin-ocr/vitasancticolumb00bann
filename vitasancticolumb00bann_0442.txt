to print it among St. Columba’s supposed compositione, and contents himself with
stating that he had sent a Latin translation of it to a contemporary writer& The Rule
of St. Columbanus‘, and the Poenit'entials of him and Cummianu are the only remains
’ of Irish monastic discipline which have descended to us, and these have probably been
modified by the peculiar institutions of the countn'es where they were observed3 and
when they arc compared with the Benedictine Rule, in all its beauty of piety, 010-
quence, and method, it is to be wondered how a lesscr light could shine beside it', and
even the one meagre Irish Rule have been transmittet] to us. NVhen saying that Colum-
banus's is the only Irish Rule which has deseended to us, it may be well to mention
that Lucas Holstenius has printed two Rules, one intituled Czy'usclam Patris Reyula ad
JlonaehosW, consisting of thirty-two chapters; and the other, Ozy'usdam Patris Regula
acl Vir-qinein of twenty-four chapters5 which Calmet has attributed to St. Comgall,
but Holstenius’s editor to St. Columba. This, however, is mere conjecture, which is
not supported even by the style or matter of the composition& In the same collection
there is an Ordo Monastieusr, purporting to be an ancient rule of discipline, “ ab anti-
quis monachis Scotis sub exordio susceptae Christianae religionis observatus,” and which
Holstcnius's editor considers the most ancient monument of au the monks of the West,
and worthy of ranking next to the institutions of Cassian, and the rule of Pachomius.
But a document which opens, as it does, with an account of the Culdees of Culros, and
derives the term [saladam from cella, however venerable it may appear to a German,
must savour to a Scot of mediaeval antiquity, especially when it is found, almost totidem
verbis, in Ricemarch's Life of David2‚ as tho discipline of the Menerian saint.

It is not necessary to reprint in this Note the only existing Reyula Cholue'm-chille,
because it is a formula intended more for a hermit than a member of a social commu-
m'ty, and tho book in which it 15 printed can readily bc consulted. The following
