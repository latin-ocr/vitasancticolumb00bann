Sammary of St. Columba's Life. lxxi

to his diligent attendance at the church of his youthful sojoum. The tradition of ‘the
country is, that hc was baptized at Tulach-Dubhglaise‚ now called Temple-Douglas'‚
a place about half way between Gartan and Letterkenny, where there is a cemeteiy
of considerable extent, containing the roofless walls of a large chapel, and, at a short
distance on the north-east, within the enelosure, a square, elevated space, which ap-
pears to have boen artifieially formed, and to be the spot which in O’Donncll's timo
was coupled with the memory of the saintw.

The place where St. Columba is said to have spent the principal portion of hjs boy-
hood was Doirc—Eithne¹‚ a hamlet in the same territory, which afterwards exchanged
this name, signifying Roboretum Ee'tlzneffe, for Cill-mae-Nemini, in commemoration, it
is supposed, of the “ Sons of Enan,’' whose mother was onc of St. Columba's sisters1.
The absence of any mention of this place in the ancient Irish Life, couplcd with the
fact that this parish was the original seat of the O'Donnells, might suggest the conjec-
ture, that it was introduced into the biography of the saint as an expedient of a later
age to add lustro to the chiefs of Tirconnell, by associating the history of their patron
with the origin of their race, were it not that there is evidence of a very early relation
between St. Columba's family and the place, in the circumstance that the O'Freels“‚
who were the ancient herenachs of the church lands there, were descended, not from
Dalaehb‚the forefathcr of the O‘Donnelk, but from Eoghan, the brother of St. Columba.
The name Cill-mac-Ncnain, also, as explained above, indicates a like connexion.

explains Cille by cellis (Colg. Act. SS. p. 336 a);
so also Notker, cited at p. 5, infra ,- but the other
authorities far ontweigh them. ‘⁴ Columba, quem
Angli vocant Collumkillum.”—Jocelin, Vit. S. Ken-
tig. c. 39. Itis tvm-thy ofobservation that the epithet
was not peculiar to st. Columba, for we find a. Colman-
cille, of the race of Colla Dachrioch, commemorated
at Oct. 1 (Cal. Donegal.; Colg. Act. SS. p. 713).

V Temple-Douylas.-So marked ou the Ord.
Survey, sheet 52. The country people call it
simply Dooylass. The grave-yard contains five
roods, and is tastefully enclosed. It is situate iu a

pretty valley under Crookatee Hm, at the bottom
of which flows the rivulet Dalm-yles, ¹ Black-
stream,’ which gave name to the place. This chapel
is situate in the parish ot* Couwal, whose patron
saint was Fiachra (Calend. Feb. 8); but its ecclc-
siastical relation to Kjlmacrenau is thus shown by
the iuqui>ition of 1609: “A chappell called Tol-
loughooghzsse, and 12 gortes or acres of free laud
to the said chapeu belonginge, out of which there is
paid yearly to the O'Freelies some rent unknowen to
the said jurors, which is the corbe ot* Kilmacreuau'v
