Now this is the cause why Molaise
seuteneed Columeille to go into Alba, be-
cause it came of h'nn to occasion three
battles in Erin, viz, the battle of Cul
Dreimhne, the battle of Rathan, and the
battle of Oui] Feadha. Tho cause of the
battle of Cul F eadm, according to the old
book called the Leabar Uidhre of Ciaran,

Ireland, made the Feast of Tura, and a
noble man was killed at that feast by
Curnan, son of Aodh‚ son of Eoehuidh
Tiorm-earna5 Wherefore Diarmuid killed
him in revenge for that, because he eom-

law and the sanctuary of> the feast; and
before Curnan was put to death he fied to
the proteotion of Columeille, and notwith-
standing the protection of Columeille he
was killed by Diarmuid. And from that it
arose that Columoifle mustered the Glanna
Neill of the North, because his own pro-
tection and the protection of the sons of
Eare was violatcd: whereupon the battle
of Cuile Dreimhne was gained over Diar-
maid and over the Connaghtmen, so that
they were defeated through the prayer of
columcille.

The Black Book of Molaga assigns ano-
ther eause why the battle of Cul Dreimhne
was fought, viz, in consequence of the
false judgment which Diarmuid gave
against columcille when he wrote the gos-
pel out of the book of Finnian without his
knowledge. Finnian said that it was to
