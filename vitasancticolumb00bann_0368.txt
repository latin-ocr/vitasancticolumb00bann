¹ comma—The two poems which are here printed
may not be genuine, but they are compositious of
considerable antiquity‚ and indicate the early no-
tions which existed in Ireland about Cormac's arl-
ventures, and his relation to St. Columba. Their
titles are given in Co1gan's list of St. Columba's
reput'ed writings (Tr. Th. p. 472 α, num. 15, 16),
and the copies of them which he used are preserved
iu the Burgundian Libras-y at Brusselffi in a volume

of manuscript collectious made by Michael O'Clery.
At the end of the former poem is a note stating that
it was copied, Dec. 22, 1630, at Drobhais [the river
Drowes, which separatesnonegal from Leitrim] from
the New Book, written by Maurice, son of Paidin
O‘Maolconaire. It was probably from the original
employed by O'Mulconry, that O'Donnell borrowed
the matter which he subjoins, in his Life of St. Co!-
umba, to the narrative of Cormac's voyages, 11. 64
