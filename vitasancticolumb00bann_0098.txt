St.. Finnjan of Mom'uff, also, soon after testified his sense of voneration for the accused,
who had been once his pupil.

Whether the censure which was expressed against St. Columba by the majority of
the 010185- had, or could have had, any influence on his after course, is diffieult to de-
termine. Irish accounts say that St. Molaisi of Devenish, or of Inishmuny-V, was the
arbiter of his future lot, who imposed upon him the penanee of perpetual exile from his
native country. But this seems to be a legendary creation of a later age, when mis-
sionary enm-prise was less characteristic of Irish ccelesiasties than in St. Columba's
day. In removing to Hy, he did no more than Donnan¹, Maehnbhaa, and Moluoob volun„
tarny performed, and Cainnech wished to do. Scotland was then a wide field for eler-
ical exertion, and St. Columba's permanent establishment in one of its outposts, within
a day's sail of his native province, entailed very little more self-denial than was required
for the repeated and, perhaps, protracted visits of St.F'1nba1··³, St. Comgall‘, 51131011-
