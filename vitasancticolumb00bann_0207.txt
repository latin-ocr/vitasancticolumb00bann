⁸ Findbarrum.—Soi. 1 (p. 13) supra. Fur-ther
on Vinnianus; and Finnio in iii. 4, infra. The
Irish pinnen, pinnen, and Pinnio, are dimi-
nutives of pmn, ¹ albus‚' equivalcnt to Albinus,
and appear iu the Latin forms Finnianus, Fin—
dianus, Fiunio, Vinnio, and Vinnianus; to which
the Italians add Fridianus and Frigidianus.
Findbarr is a compound name, formed from
pinn homi, ‘pulcher vertex,' “ propter can-
dorem capillorum.” (Colg. Act. SS. p. 638 a.)
There were two famous abbots called Finnian,
who were suecessively teachers of St. Columba:
one of them founder of Magh-bile. now Movilla
in Down; the other, of Cluain-Eraird, now
Clonard in Meath. With the former of these,
the ancient lrish Life, followed by O'Donnell
(i. 39, Tr. Th. p. 395 α), Keating (req. Aodh),
and Lanigan (Ee. H. ii. p. 117), identifies the
Findbarr of the text. tuno lemuril *oo ῥοδ-

went, then, to learn wisdom, to the illustrious
bishop, namely, Finden of Magh-bile. On a
certain occasion wine and bread were wanting
to Finden sor 'the offertory: Columcille blessed
the water, audit was tux-ned into wine, and put
in‘to the offertor-y chalice.' With this agree the
Lives of SS. Ere and Callin (Colg. Act. SS.

p. 644 a). Colgan is undecided in his choico.
sor at Feb. 23 he inclines to Clonard (Act. SS.
pp. 403 b, 644 α); and at March 18 to Movilla
(lb. p. 644 ας Tr. Tr. p. 381 a). St. Finnian
of Movilla was son of Cairbre, one of the Dal
Fiatach, the royal family oftssster, and became
the patron saint of the Ultonians (Reeves, Eccl.
Ant. p. 151)· Besides Movilla, he was the
founder of Druim-fionn, now Dromin in Lonth
(‘ Eccl. S. Fintani de Dromyng‚'-Regist. Fle-
ming, fol. 44 a); and here the (lispute between
him and St. Columba respecting the manuscript
of the Gospels is said to have occurred. 110
died Sept. ιο, which is his festival; and his
obit is thus recorded by 'l'ighernaeh at 579:
Quies Flauiani episcopi IVepolis Fiulacli. Wthre
O'Conor corruptly for Finnizmi reads sslani.
Also in the Annal. Ult.. at 578: Quies Vin-
w'am' episcopi mic [filii] IVepotis Flatach. as
in the Dublin MS.; though O'Conor's text
unmeaningly gives Umanz'm'n as the Saint's
name. The Irish Life states that St. (¹0-
lumba, on leaving St. Finnian of Maghbile,
placed himself under a senior called Gemman
mentioned at ii. 25, infra), from whom he re-
moved to St. Finnian of Clonard. The Life
by Cummian subjoins the present aneedote to
that recorded at iii. 4, infra, where see note.
