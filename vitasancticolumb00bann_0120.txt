—Bede‚ H. E. iii. 1.

¹ Trucidato Catlone.-“ In loco qui lingua
Anglorum Denisesburna, id est, Rivus Denisi
vocatur.‘'—Bede, H. E. iii. 1. The British
gave it a different name ε “Osuuald filius Ead-
fred regnavit novem annis, ipse est Osuuald
Lamnguin [pulchrae manus] ς ipse occidit Cat—
gublaun regem Guenedotae regionis in bello
Cati-canl cum magna clade exercitus sui.''—
-Nennius‚ H. B. ἓ 64 (Ed. Stev.) Bede aud
the Saxon Chronicle place the battle in 635,
but the Irish and Welsh Annals earlier:

Geoffrey of Monmouth, perverting Bede’s
narrative, states that Oswald, having overeome
Cadwalla at Heavenfield, was afterwards de-
feated at Burne, and killed by Penda, He
also represents Cadwalla as surviving Oswald
many years, and dying in the arms of peace;
while he reserves the final prostration of the
Britons for the twelfth year of his son's reign.

³¹ Ford. Adomnano A.

Scottorum, et Anglorum divisae sunt', in ditione
accepit.”—Bede, H. Ε. iii. 6. The present pas-
sage is cited by ΜΓ. Hallam as “probably a
distinct recognition of the Saxon word Bret-
walzla; for what else could answer to Emperor
of Britain? 11 seems more likely that Adam-
nan refers to a distinct title bestowed on Os-
wald by his subjects‚ than that he means to
assert as a fact, that he truly ruled over all
Britain.” But this idea is not in harmony with
Adamnan’s or Bede's assertion. Mr. Hallam
certainly errsin asserting that Cummineus' Life
of Sty Columba “is chiefly taken from that by
Adamnan.''-—Middlc Ages, vol. ii. p. 350 (Lond.
1853). See Saxon Chron. Α. Ι). 827‚where Os-
wald is set down as the sixth king “ who was
Bret-walda.''—(Monum. Hist. Br. p. 343); Lin-
gard, Hist. Engl. cap. ii.

δ Α Deo ordinatus est.—-This divine right is
expressed at i. 36, of a soyereign os Ireland;
and at iii. 5, of a prince of Dalriada.

first person again at chaps. 2, 3, 49, ii. 45, 46,

d Fuilbeus.—Failbhe‚ son of Piopan‚ eighth
abbot of Hy, presided from 669 to 679. His
festival is March 2, at which day Colgan has
collected the few particular-s of his history
which are recorded (Act. SS.p. 719). He is
mentioned again in cap. 3, as the chaunel of
information from Segineus.—See the Appendis.

Β Seyineo.--Seghine, son of Fiachna, fifth ab-
bot of Hy, governed from 623 to 652; so that
the reign of Oswald, which was from 634 to
642, fell within the term ofhis presidency. His
