6 (Colgan, Act. SS. p. 336 b); Keating, His-
tory (Κεφ. Aedh). The present reading, how-
ever, is found in all the MSS. 'l‘ighernach
reem-ds the death of a Scanlaun Mor, son of
Cennfaeladh, at ⁶43, but. the interval between
the date ofthe Convention and that year is too
long to harmonize with the statements in this
chapter. Resides, we find “Colmanus filius
Fearaffle, dux regionis Osraidhe‚'’ expressly
mentioned in the Life of Cainnech. as that
saint's patron (chaps. 43, 44, 47; pp. 26, 27,
29. Ed. Ormonde), as also 111 the Life of St.
Mochoemog (chap. 30, Colg. Act. SS. p. 594 b);
and his death is recorded by Tighernach at
605, and Four Mast. 601. Cennfaeladh, father
of Scanlann Mor, was first cousin of this Col-
man.

'³ &tentum—Some say that lie was delivered
as a hostage by his sathem others, that he had
been put in bonds for refusing to pay the¹ cus-
tomary tribute to the monareh. Again, it is
alleged that one of Aedh’s motives for con-
vening this assembly was to procuro his formal
deposition, and that one of St. Columba's rea-
sons for attending was to procure his liberation.
See O'Donnell, iii. 2 (Tr. Th. p. 430 a); Keat-
ing, Hist. (req. Aedh); Colgau (Tr. Th. p. 375,
n. 48.) Irish legends state that the place of
his confinement was Ard-mac-nDobran, near
St. Columba’s Dubh Regles at. Dcrry. (H. z,
16, T. C. D. fol. 680.)

called the Bachall Mor, which he carried with
him as a safe conduct; that his father died on
