As regards the wriffing, there are three hands discernible3 the first that of
the substance of the manuscript, which is very uniform, and never departs
from the steady boldness of the letter, except where a new pen produces an in-
crease of sharpness and smoothness of stroke. A second hand, possibly from
the same writer, but with a different ink and pen, and in a smaller, rounder
letter, appears on p. 108 a, beginning at the words Cummeneus Albus ἰη libro‘,
dcc. in iii. 5 (199), to the end of the chapter. The third hand is the later and
inferior one which has made the corrections in the orthography in different
places. As regards ornament, capitalsss, some of them of considerable sizo,
'are liberally used: the books open with very large letters, and the initials of
the chapters are proportionably distinguished. In every column, where a new
clause commences, the first letter is daubed with red or yellow paint. There
is a total absence, however, of interlaeing or artistic work, and the capitale are
illuminated by the simple process of dotting the substance of the stroke with
yellow, or its margins with red, and filling up the hollow with red or yellow.
The capitulationes at the commencemcnt, the tituli of the chapters, and the
colophon of the scribe, are all written in rubrie, which ie in general very fresh
and beautiful& Over the signs of abbreviation, also, there is commonly added :i
similar stroke in red. The ordinary ink is generally very dai-kf, bnt it varies,
in some places being as black as jet, in other places turned brownk. The book
itself is in quarto, and consists of 68 leaves each measuring 10} by 83,- inchcs.

ι’ Proper names.—The same system ofaecent-
uation exists in the Latin tracts at the begin-
ning of the Book of Armagh‚ except that the

iDarAa-Dr. Keller‘s observation on this
subject is very just: ‘⁴ In deu {inei-n irischen

aceents are more numerous, sometimes accom-
panying every letter in a proper name, some-
times only the vowels. By this means the

proper names, in the absence of capitals, can
be discerned at a glauce.
