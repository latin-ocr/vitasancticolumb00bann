ium, adding titles to the chapters, and appending a few marginal glosses,
together with testimonias of Adamnan, at the beginning, and of St. Columba,
at the end, of the Life.

About the same time, Stephen Whitec, a learned J esuit, a native of Clon-
mel, discovered, while in search of Irish manuscripts on the Continent, a
venerable copy of Adamnan in the Benedictine monastery of Reichenmi, and
the transcript which hc made supplied the text of the fourth Life of St. Co-
lumba in Colgan's Trias Thaumaturgad, published in 1647. The editor of the
work prefixes numbers to the Chapters, which are not in the original, and errs
wherever White has made an omission or alteration in the text, but in other
respects is remarkably faithful. The notes display considerable learning and
vast acquaintance with the eeclesiastical reeords of his country, but his conjec-

uano Abbate. ΕΖ tomo 4. antiquoe lectionis Henrici
canisii, ξφα, accompanied by an engraving of the
saint, habited in his cowl⁷ having a mitre lying
at his feet, and underneath, the motto Quis da—

Β White.—His Apoloyz'a pro Hibernia adver-
sus cambri calumnias was printed in 1849 by
the Rev. Matthew Kelly, from a MS. preserved
in Brussels. White lent his copy of the 391011911-
au MS. to Ussher previously to 1639, who occa-
sionally refers to it; thus, speaking of Vitus's
identification os lepnon and Ferreolus (237), he
adds: “Ita enim habebat antiquissimum quo
ille usus est, ex Benedictino Augiae Divitis 111
Suevia coeuobio petitum, exemplar'¹ (Wks. vi.
p. 541)· Elsewhere he cites it as Aayz'ens. MS.
(ib. p. 245, and iv. p. 456), or Vet. MS. (vi. pp.
523, 526, 527, 530). White furnished Ussher
with many other sruits of his Continental
searehes, which the Arehbishop acknowledges
(Wks. vi. pp. 269, 274); and a folio MS. of
Ussher’s, containing these communications of
White's, was lately sold by Mr. Kerslake of
Bristol. The long extract from the anony-
mous Life of St. Columba which Ussher has
printed, “ut a Stephano Vito humanissime
communicatum accepimus'' (Wks. vi. p. 466),
is most probably from White's own pen. The

Arehbishop in another place reeords 3 literary
performance‚ ⁴⁶ a Stephano Vito viro antiqui-
tatum, non Hiberniae solum suae sed aliarum
etiam gentium scientissimo'' (Wks. v. p. 458).
It is refreshing to witness the literar-y friend-
ship which existed in this case between men of
different communiens, and in an age when party
feeling ran high; a tie which, in like manner,
bound Ussher to Sirmondus and David Roth.
There is less satisfaction at finding Ward, in
the same page of his Rumold, passing from the
“doctissimus polyhistor Stephanus Vitus” to
“Jacobus Usserius hodiernus Armachanae Se-
dis Pseudo-primas, sacrarum antiquitatum Bri-
tannicarum vir peritior (quod dolendum plane)
quam sequacior'' (p. 180).
