xxxviii Preface.

present volume, its character for elegance3 and the editor feels bound to re-
cord the skill and intelligence which it has been his happiness on all occasions
to experience in the operations of that office.

Mr. John Bartholomew‚ J un.‚ deserves great credit for the admirable style
in which he has engraved the two maps which accompany this work. His
merit is enhanced by the consideration that he was previously unacquainted
with the Irish letter, and that in executing the map of Ireland he was at once
the learner and the accomplished artist-

To John C. Nicholl‚ of Merthyr Mawr, Esq., the editor is indebted sor
the use of a manuscript volume² containing Archbishop Ussher’s copyf of
Stephen White's conatione· of the Reichenau codex: and the favour was the
greater as it was conferred upon a stranger.

There was a time when the confident manner in which the name δεοΐὶα,
and its derivatives‚ are limited in the following pages to lreland and its rela-
tions, would have been pronounced by the inhabitants of North Britain to be
bigotry or presumption3 but sortunately that day of prejudice is past: Chal·
mers and Pinkerton brought it to an end3 so that now, as an enlightened
writer¹¹ observes, “from Maiden Kirk to John O’Groat you will hardly find

ΕΜΞ. colurna—This is the book which is
mentioned in note& p. ix. supra. On the fly-
leaf is written: “ Sum ex libris Jacobi Tyrrell,
A.D. 1662.” James Tyrrell was Abp. Ussher's
grandson, and this volume seems to be one of
those which changed hands when Shotover
House passed into another family.

s Usslzer’s copy.—A portion is in the delicate
and beautiful hand of the amanuensis who
prepared a copy of the Primordia (now in the
editor's possession) for the second edition; the
rest is in the Archbishop's own writing.

g White‘s callatim—It commences thus :
‘⁶ I. H. S. Maria. Stephanus Vltus Lectori.
Nuper ex coenobio Benedictinorum in Suevia ce-
leberrimo Augia Dives dicto, vulgo Reichenaw,
allatus est ad me Dilingam vetustissimus Mae
nuscriptus Codex membranaceus, continens
folia (communis magnitudinis) sexaginta sep-
tem. In quo, parum polito sermone Latino, sed
in caracteribus ibernicis (multum diversis ab

aliarum gentium scripturis), per quendam Mo-
nachum, ut videtur lbernum, qui ad finem co-
dicis se Dorbbeneum nominat, descripti sunt
tres libri quos ante annos amplius quam non-
gentos primus scripsit evulgavitque Beatus
Adonmanus Abbas.'' Some remarks on tho
age of Adamnan, and the style of the memoir,
are subjoined, which agree exactly with what
has been stated in a preceding part os this
Prcface. In the margin, opposite S. White's ac-
count of the manner in which he became ac-
quaintcd with the MS.. is the date, '‘An. 1621,
31 Maii,‘¹ in Usshcr’s writing. A marginal
note of Ussher's on the title of the Preface re-
cords the existence ofa MS. of Adamuan not
noticed elsewhere: ‘¹ MS. San Mielanus in Lo-
tharingia: Incipit Prcrfalio prima Apoloyiaque
Eadomnani sancti Scriptura-,³¹ S. Miel stands
on the east bank of the Mense, in Lorraine.

¹¹ libita—Ioseph Robertson, Esq.‚ in letter
to the editor, Sept. ιο, 1856.
