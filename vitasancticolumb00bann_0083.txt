lisemoir of St. Adamnan. lix
which it has sometimes been judgcd desirable to invalidate. Sir J ames Dahymple, in
1714, when defendjng the Presbyteri-<m view of Church govemmentz found it eonve-
nient to throw discredit on the anecdote told in i. 44 (p. 8 ς, infra), and, as a means
towards this, called the genuineness of the whole work in question. “ Ι cannot agree,”
says Sir J ames “ With our Biographoru, that the Authority of Adanmanus is equal, far
less, preferable, to that of Bede, since it was agreed on au hands to be a fabulous Histor5‚
lately published in his N ame, and that he was remarkable for nothing, but that he was
the first Abbot of that Monastery, who quit the Scottt'sh Institution, and became fond
of the Enylish Romz'sh Rites.’' In our own day Doctor Grues, when translating Bode's
Ecclesiastical History, added the remark‘: “ Besides the work ‘ On the Holy Places,’
Adamnan is the reputed author of a ⁴ Life of Saint 00111mba‚’ but Ι have strong doubts
of Adamnan’s having written it. I propose shortly to publish the original text of both
these works.’' On what the writcr's scmples were founded does not appear, ns the
proposed opportunity of dcclaring it has never occurred. It is to bc hoped that the
doubts originated in a different style of research from that which made Bede’s Colum-
cella· an islandw, and Dearmach the same as Dcrry¹ l Lastly, in 1851, a Prussiau
elergyrnam, hoping to extend to a portion of British antiquitics the enlightenment of
German criticism, objected to the Vita Adamnani on these grounds: “ Haec ipsa adeo
fabulis est obscurata, ut vix credi possit, vii saeculo, quo literae apud Hyicnscs flo-
ruerunt, ejusmodi nugas esse conscriptas. Prologi autem Vitae suspicionem mihi
faciunt, quorum titulum ¹ Praefatio Apologiaque Adamnam' Abbatis sancti scriptoris' a
librario esse praepositum nemo non videt, apologiam vem, quae tam stylo ae sermone
quam re aliena sit a Vita ipsa, ficticium esse, facilc apparet.'’ But surely these arc
not the observatione· osone qurdified to pronounce judgment on such a question. If
παραὶ and fabzdae such as Adamnan's indicate spuriousness, what becomes of carly
biography? As to the title of the Prologue, had he consulted a good editiou¹, he might

again, “juxta exemplar quod mihi Arculfus in pagi-
nola figuravit cerata depinximus” (i. 3).
