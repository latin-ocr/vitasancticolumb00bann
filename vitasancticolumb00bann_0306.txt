[Lm. 111.

¹DE ANGELORUM APPARITIONE ALICUJUS BEATI BRITONIS ANIMAM AD COELUM
VEHENTIUM.

Amo ²in tempore, cum vir sanctus in Ioua ³oommoraretur insula, quidam
de suis ⁴monachis, Brito, bonis actibus intentus, molestia correptus corporis,

mian in Mabillon thus expresses the fulfilment
of St.Columba's prediction: ‘⁸ Quod ita factum
est: mandatum namque viri Dci transgredi-
entes, regnum perdiderunt.” Colgan's text is
less explicit: ‘⁴ Quod ita evenit mandatum viri
Dei transgredientibus.’¹ The expression rey-
num perdiderunt seems to refer to the departure
of the sceptre from the house οἷ Gabhran to
that of Loarn, which took place when Ferchar
Fada succceded Maelduin. Chalmers fixes this
event at 681, while the Irish Annals record the
death of Maelduin at 689. 1n either case the
words appear to be interpolated, for Cumrnian
‹lied in 669. Adamnan, however, with propriety
uses the words in the text, for he was thirteen
years old when the battle of Magh Rath was
fought, and he lived to see Ferchar Fada, of
the house of Loarn‚ several years on the throne.
During this period various reverses happened
to the house of Gabhram and not only did the
rival families of the race improve them to their
own advantage, but the Picts, Strathclyde
Britons, and Saxons were sure to profit by
their neighbours‘ declension. T ighernach re-
cords, at 678, and the An. Ult. 677 [recte 634,

in which the army of Domhnall Breacc was
routed: and the siege of Etan.’ The scene of
this battle was not Glenmorison, on Loch
Ness in Inverness, as Chalmers (i. p. 286) and
O'Conor (vol. iv. p. 47) suggest, but a tract
in the debateable ground of West Lothiau.
Emu, again, is not Edinburgh, as some sup-
pose (Williams, Gododin. p. 99), which was
anciently Agned, and Dun Monaidh, but Cair-
Eden, the Eiddyn of Aneurin (Gododin, vss.
113, 157, 183, 733), now Carridem a parish

other cases, and indicates the employment of a
different authority. There king Hoanis called
