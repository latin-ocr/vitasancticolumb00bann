tary history of Ireland, rises in the north-
west of the county of Kildare, and, enter-
ing the eounty of Meath, pursnes a north-
easterly course, and, widening as it approaches
Drogheda, falls into the sea at Colpe. the an-
cient irffiep Colpcha. It was the southern
limit of Ulster in its largest proportions, and
was also a boundary of Bregia. (O'Donovan‚
Ir. Gram. p. 318) An interesting account of
the river and its neighbourhood, along its en-
tire course, may be seen in Wilde's Beauties os
the Boyne and Blackwater (Dubl. 1850).

Ε Pelliceo saccula—For convenience and
safety's sake, the service-books, which the
itinerant habits of the early Irish ecclesiastics
required them to carry about from place to
place, were provided with leather cases which
varied in size and execution. They were called
polonie and eiussn, which are thus distin-
guished in the ancient Irish Life of St. Co-
lumba: unm bo ber oo rum cpepru ocor*
polome ocos· ειοδο lebop ocor oi‘ome eolor-
τοσοῦ oo oenum, ‘ sor it was his custom to
make crosseS, and cases, and satchels sor books,
and all cburch surniture) The potuine (written
pootme in the Book of Armagh, fol. 18 α h) is
explained inan old gloss, uinrn oo ce15 hubam,
‘name for a cover of a book‚' and seems to have
been the case of a. single book, carefully formed
and embossed. Thus St. Dega, a famous arti-
ficer, among other articles of eeclesiastical fur-
niture, is said to have made “ librorum cooper-

toria, quaedam horum nuda. quaedam vero alia
auro atque argento gemmisque pretiosis cir-
cumtecta.”-Acta SS. Aug. tom. iii. p. ⁶59 a.
Of leather cases the cover of the Book of Ar-
magh is the most interesting example now
remaining. It came, together with its inesti-
mable enclomre, into the writer's possession
at the end of 1853, and is now lying before him.
lt is formed of a single pieoe of strong leather
36 inches long, and 12 broad, folded in such a
way as to form a six-sided case η inches long,
12} broad, and 23 thick, having a flap which
doubles over in front3 and is furnished with a
rude look, and eight staples, admitted through
perforations in the flap, for short iron rods to
enter, and meet at the lock. The whole outer
surstzee, which has become perscctly black from
age, is covered with figures and interlacings
of the Irish pattern in relief, which appear to
have been produced by subjecting the leather
in a damp state, before it was folded, to pres-
sure upon a block of the whole size having a
depressed pattern, and allowing it to remain
till the impression became indclible. A reduced
drawing of the back, faithfully executed, may
be seen in Petrie’s Ronnd Towers, p. 327. But
as this ease does not fit the book, which, with-
out the boards, measures only 7522 by 5} inches
and is thicker than the receptacle‚ it is likely
to have been one of a number of impressions
executed from the same block for various ma-
nuscripts. At the upper corners of the sides
are the remains of coarse straps which were
stitched on with leather thongs. These were
for the purpose of slinging the case from the
shoulder, like a modern postbag. It is remarka-
ble that all the books iu the libr-ary of the Abys-
sinian monastery of Souriani, on the Natron
Lakes in Egypt, were recently found by an
