founders respectively of the kingdoms of
Meam, Tyrone, and Tirconnell. Diarmait be-
longed to the first family, and was the eighth
monarch of the race.

¹ ominatum—Dr. Lanigan observes: “What
will those who abet the fable of Columha’s ex-
eiting a war against Dierruit say ot'this trans-
action? Will they venture to asscrt, that he
would not have scrupled to contribute to tho
death of that monarch, while he was tired with
such iudignation against the man who actually
killed him ?” (Eccl. Hist. ii. p. 169.) The priu-
ciple of war, however, is different from that of
assassinatffin, and the evidence in favour osSt.
Columba's exertions against Diarmait is too
strong to be so easily set aside. The will of
Providence in ecclesiastical appointment is re—
cognised by our author in iii. 8, 19; and in
seculai· in i. ι, ¹4· and the present case3 which
is the more remarkable, as at this period a
vacancy was seldom created in royalty by na-
tural causes. war and assassination being the
usual avenues to the throne.

¹¹³ Transactum tempus—An early canon of the
lrish Church ordained: “Omnes homicidae, si
toto corde conversi suerint, septem annorum
penitentiam districte sub regula Monasterii
poeuiteant.” (D'Achery‚ Spicileg. tom. ix.
p. 16. par. 1669.) See ii. 39 infra.

¹¹ Accito episcopa-This monastery was re-
gulated by the discipline of the parent institu-
tion, in which a presbyter was Superior. and,
in virtue ot¹ his conventual rank, exercised ju-
risdiction over the associate bishops, without,
however, the slightest attempt to usurp the
functions of their order. The present narra-
tive is a very valuable illustration of Bede’s
statement concerning the administrative eco-
nomy of Hy (H. E. iii. 4), and the sagacious
Τ. Innes fails not to turn to good account the
evidence which it so decisively affords. He

observes: “Since Findchan was resolvet] to
have Aidus made pricst at any rate, the or-
daining him by Findchan himself, and the other
presbyters and seniors ofa monastery, in so re-
mote a corner, might have made no noise any-
where else. Now when we see that Findehan,
notwithstanding his earnestness to get Aidus
ordained priest, and the importance os not di-
vulging the ordination osa man so infamous for
his crimes, could find no other means os having
his ordination performed than by sending, and
perhaps far enough, through the Picts and
Scots, sor a bishop‚ which could not fail to
make a noise; and in the next place, that he
engaged the hishop to perform the function-
notwithstanding his reluctancy to take upon
himself alone the guilt osan ordination (which
it appears he doubted, at least, was criminal
and sacrilegious) unless Findchau would at
same time lay his right hand upon Aldus to bear
a part, as it were, of the guilt and of the re·
proach. When we consider, Ῑ say, and ponder
all the circumstances ofthis ordination,it seems
not possible to conceive that Findchan, with all
his qualities of priest, of founder, and of Supe-
rior of a Columbite monastery, and, by conse-
quence, that any other Abbot, Superior, or
Priest of Ycolmkill, or all of them together,
destituted of the episcopal Character, ever so
much as claimed, or pretended any right or
power to ordain a priest, much less to ordain
or consecrate a bishop.'' (Civil and Eccles.
Hist. p. 181.)

⁰ Imponeree dexteram—Though there was an
apparent compliance with the canon os the
fourth Council of Carthage, which enacted
that the presbyters present at the ordination
of a priest “manus suas juxta manum Epis-
copi super caput illius teneant,‘' yet it would
seem that regard was not had to it on the pre-
sent occasion, because Findchan was required
