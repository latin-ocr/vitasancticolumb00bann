Broken is my heart in my breast:
should sudden death overtake me,

It is for my great love of the Gaedhil.

Gaedhss, GaedhiL boloved name!
My only desire is to invoke it:
Beloved is Cuixnjn2 of fair hain
Beloved are Cm'nnecha and Comghall.

Were ‘tho tribute of all Alba mine,
From its contre to its border,
Ι would prefer the site of one house
In the. middle of fair Derryb.

The reason Ι love Derry is,
For its quietness, for its purity,
And for its orowds of white angolS‚
From the one end to the other.

The reason why 1 love Dcrry is,
For its qujethSS, for itssspurity,
crowded qu of heaven's angols
Is every leaf of the oaks of Derry.

My Derry, my little oak-grove‘,
My dwelhng, and my little ch;
O etcrnal God, in heaven above,
Woe be to him who m‘olates it Ι

Beloved are Durrow, and Dcrry3
Boloved is Raphoe in p1u⁷ity3
Boloved Dmmhomed of rich fmit53
Beloved asc Swords, and Kells.
