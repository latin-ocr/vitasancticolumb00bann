Mochta de Insula, son of Cernaehan, who died
in 922 at his church of Inis-Mochta, now Inish-
mot, in the county of Meath. The former, in his
life, is described as “ortus ex Britannia.'' and
as landing 31 0111811111, 111 the county of Louth,
with twelve followers. Hence his title “pros-
elytus'' Tighernach and the Annals os Ulster
record his death at 534: ¹¹ Dormitatio Moctai

Life of St. Patrick ‘⁴ Patricii Archipraesbyter‚''
(iii. 98. Tr. Th. p. 167). He may be the Mauo-

Ulster at 471, 511, 527. The Calendars style
him bislzop, but the authorities here cited limit
his rank to the priesthood. See Colg. Act. SS.

Ardpatriek, which lay about halfa mile south-
east, aud Cnoc-na-seangain. where the abhey
of Knock was founded, in 1 148, are both in the
parish of Louth, and one of them may origi-
nally have been appropriated as in the text.
O'Donnell refers this propheey to Iona, and
represents St. Mochta as sojourning there be-
fore 1110 settlement os Columba-i. 3 (Tr⁴ Th.
p. 389 b.) But this is opposed 10 the statement
in St. Mochta's Life: ‘⁴ Alio ternpore offerente

pere renuit. dieens; Nascetur in aquilonali Hi-

cap. 16 (Act. SS. p. 730 IJ); where—(notwith-
standing a great anachronism, for St. Mochta
died 111 5343 whereas Aodh son of Colga, the
alleged donor, lived till 606)-we have evidence
that Ireland was referred 1ο, and that part of
it in which Louth is situate, for this prinee was
