with the present monastery was long main-
tained, for in 938 Muircertach Camsa, that is.
‘ ofCamus,' was abbot oi'Bangor.—FonrMast.
Camus gave name to a parish situate on tho
west ofthe Banu, in the diocese of Derry, which,
for distinction's sake, is called Canms juxta
Banu, there being another ofthe same name in
the Tyrone part of the diocese, stylml, from
the neighbouring river, Comus juxta Monrne.
Au island in the Bann, opposite the churchyard
of Camus, was formerly called Imp [ochum
(Fonr Mast. 1170, 1544), beside which was a
shallow spot known as peupcflp Campo, ‘ the
Ford os Camus‚' from which the island is called
Enis Forsed on Specd's Map of Ulster. ln the
twelsth century an abbey was founded in ano-
ther part os the pai-ish. called in Cistercian re-

overturtied, and, having bec-n mutilate-d. was
converted into a gnte-post for the ehurchyard.
