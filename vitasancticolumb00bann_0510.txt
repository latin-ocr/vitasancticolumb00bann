Surnamed Ua Clueaz'n, of the same family as his predecessor, No* xm.

During his

presidency the Disert of Kells received the endowment recorded iu the first Charter of Kella

s Remum-sne seems to have been daughter of
Conghalach mac Couchaille, who died in 1112.
The editor of Ord. Memoir of Templemore suggests
that she was abbess οἶα nunnery (p. 25); but in
the absence of any positive evidence that such an
institution existed iu Derry at this date, it is more
reasonable to suppose that this female had become,

by right of inheritance, or other claim, possessed of
the church lands of θοι-ιγ. At 1078 we find the
enricus entry in the Annals of Ulster (omitted as

libellous by the Four Masters), ⁸⁴ Duibheam, daugh-
ter of Amhalgaidh, coarb of Pati-iek, aud wife of
the king of Odor, died.‘¹ Ailbhe, daughter of the
Abbot [ιηδειη m‘o obbmb, not innabon, asin
O'Conor], queen of the same territory, who died in
¹077v is described as coarb of Mouinna. Gorm-
luith, daughter of Min-chadh, coarb of Bridget,
died in 1112. The family of Mac Conchaille were
a branch of the Cinei Binnigh, a section os the
Cinel-Eoghain. See Colton's Visitation, p. 74.
