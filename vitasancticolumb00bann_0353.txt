himself belonged the son-book [copy]
which was written from his book, and
they both selected Diarmuid as 1udge be-
tween thom. This is tho decision that
Diarmuid made: that to every book be-
longs its son-book [copy]5 as to every coxv
belongs her calf. So that this is one of
the two causes why the battle of Cuile
Dreimhne was fought.

This was the cause which brought Co-
lumefflo to be induced to fight the battle of
Cuil Rathan against the Dal n-Araidhe,
and against the Ultonians, Via, in conse-
quence of the controversy that took place
between Colum and Comgall, because they
took part against Colum in that contro-
versy.

This was the cause that occasioned the
fighting of the battle of Cui] Foadha
against Colman Mac Diarmada, viz.y in
revenge for his having been outragcd in
the case of Baodan, son of N inncadh (king
of Erin), who xvas killed by Cuimin, son
of Colman, at Leim-an-eich, in violation
of the sanctuary of Colum.

original is not a manuscript of the Gospels, as stated in the above extract, but the copy
of the Psalms, which forms, with its silvei· caso, the ancient reliquai'y called the Cath-
ach, of which O'Donnell gives us this carious account : ⁷
